      <description>As a way to potentially incorporate weather data into poems and as a way to better get to know the forest and meadows by my house, I wanted to find a way to pull in historical weather information for a specific set of geographical coordinates.
I’m using the darksky package in R:

      <description>Looking at the way that the Self, Nature and the Sublime are framed in Romantic-era science, it is intriguing to see how (even in fields supposedly untinged by subjectivity), the medium conveys and marinades the message.

Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle.
 He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy.
 In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker.</description>
