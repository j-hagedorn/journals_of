<p>Looking at the way that the <em>Self</em>, <em>Nature</em> and the <em>Sublime</em> are framed in Romantic-era science, it is easy to see how (even in fields supposedly untinged by subjectivity), the medium conveys and marinades the message.</p>
<p>The converse is also true, and some media are inimical to conveying certain types of messages or subjects. For instance, <code>syllogisms &lt;&gt; mysticism</code>, or <code>koans &lt;&gt; empirical experiments</code>, or <code>tweets &lt;&gt; dramatic monologues</code>. This is not to say that one couldn’t rassle these subjects into these forms; but the result would smack more of the incongruity, or the <em>pomo</em> dilution of meaning itself.</p>
<p>I can’t help but think (or hope) that much of the subsequent erasure of the <em>Sublime</em> from scientific discourse after the Romantic period was due to a greater mechanization of method rather than any failure to experimentally verify the <em>Sublime</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
