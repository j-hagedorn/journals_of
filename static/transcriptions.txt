The mountain reddens; chickens call
acorns down from a tree.

If the world is an illusion,
what matter
if one more caged beast escapes?


Scapoli, 2017.
Haunted by the thought that I have pulled my children across an ocean, running away from a toxic culture that seems to be an allergy peculiar to me.  That perhaps my ceaseless pulling is not heroic at all: not an act of saving them but of holding them back from happiness.  That I am a tether, holding their brightness close to me because I do not have my own.

I feel mostly solitary here, no different than ever.  Except that each moment is buoyed by an undercurrent - centuries of human attention pored over the radiating stone streets, the arches vaulting each sequent courtyard's haven.  And beyond, the mountains.  Eons-old, the dizzy escarpments and chloropyll-clotted ridges.

At home among the aged accumulations, as among the distilled richness of poems or oil paintings.  





You have to be alive to give your life.  

To slowly scrape away one's humanity until it is a trinket, easy to part with, is not the thick-blooded love of the martyrs.

On the contrary, it would almost be a relief to part with this trinket self, to relinquish its choices to corporations and its ideas to machines.

It has been hardest to remember the blood in our veins.

We return to the plainest facts as though they were visions.

The miracle of mere fact tugs against delusion.

Vast, ingenious machinery of self-deception.

The bark of beeches, broken from inside.
Grown large from fear of want.

(There is always enough, though enough may exclude me.)

All scars are an encounter with our limits.
Skinned knees, surgeries. The House of God.

----

I fear that I will fail, or
I fear that the works of my hands will fail, or
I fear that my works are my worth, or 
I fear that my children are my works, and 
I do not let them loose to the wind
to create and be created, or
I fear that my children will see my failure
and judge themselves the fruit of failure
and close themselves away from open hope, or
I fear that I will fail 
and no one will know, 
and I will not change.

Furious black flies, my eyes 
scribble over the landscape.  Clicking windows.
Seeking distraction from gravity.

"Blessed is the man, whose hope is in the Name of the Lord,
& who hath not looked upon vanities and false frenzies."  - Ps. 39, For the end

How can hope rest in a name?  
How is that name an antidote to frenetic madness?

Town facing the,
made of the mountains

Travertine citadel. 
Angles and convolutions.

Rain flows through
stone rooms.

Grass grasps
whichever interstice.

----

The tight dance, turn
& counterturn, blind

bends beneath clotheslines
dried by a sun's echoes.

Alleys open upon
infinite hills

gathering upon hills, over
groves shimmer 
& grooves

All we have made 
rides this slow tumult, turn
& counterturn

Vastness hunts us.  This view
peering through halls into
our daily round

O Cell, whose nucleus is Hell

A seed seems a stone.

What has left, when life is gone?

Metabolism, a translation

"We are all lost in translation..." - J. Merrill
"...we will all be changed" - St. Paul

Unlike an elephant, a root will grow forever
given adequate nutrition

10.17.17 Monte Marrone

Moss clasps rock facets.
Persistent tufts.

Miniature coral stilled.

----

branching calligraphy of aching and fulfillment

----

Birdsong.

Valleys of sound between rippling rock.

Catch in the throat, upturned stone.

With what language can I tell 
you the mountain?

Montecassino.  10.18.17

S. Benedict is buried here.  Strange to come to a place where the rule, and the marking of hours, the keeping of time, were implemented.

People move from the flail of civilization to a remote place on a mountain.  They press numbers into their days, discipline into their flesh.  Their spines curl above pages of glyphs, a terrarium of symbols.

These people went to stick their hands into something true -- and likely did.

Now strangely their tools have descended the mountain, and just as those monks felt lost in the tumult of their dying flesh and removed themselves, now I am lost in an infinite (though not eternal) grid of time and information.  And I feel remote from the ground of my life, here on a mountain of logic, of sequence without consequence.

How do tools of spirit twist and become viral?

By using them to control others?  In the monastery, one 'took on' the clock (or bell) just as one 'took on' the task of copying.  Like a mantle.

Now, however, it would seem almost absurd to speak about having a choice of whether to abide by the clock.

[Except in small towns, perhaps, where peopl are known and have a grace for the unnevenness of time.]

Today the impulse toward the sacred is often an impulse away from rules, abstractions, bureaucracies.  It pulses toward the physical ground of our being.  To touch the dirt of ones death and stay there with it.
