Play, sex, cuisine, creativity, altruism, pets, grieving rituals, and other oft-neglected topics broaden the scope of this fascinating study. This tract is imbued with historical perspectives that reveal the continuity in the evolving science and research of this discipline over the past century. The author places classic schemas and constructs, as well as current principles, in the context of their socio-political catalysts. He further relates this study of the person to life-span developmental issues and to cultural, gender-specific, trait-based, genetic/epigenetic, and evolutionary research findings. Personality psychology has recently reconciled itself to more modest paradigms for describing, explaining, and predicting human behaviour than it generated in the 19th and 20th centuries. This book documents that transformation, providing valuable information for health-service professionals as well as to teachers, researchers, and scientists.},

These findings indicate the existence of 2 distinct (but correlated) aspects within each of the Big Five, representing an intermediate level of personality structure between facets and domains. The authors characterized these factors in detail at the item level by correlating factor scores with the International Personality Item Pool (L. R. Goldberg, 1999). These correlations allowed the construction of a 100-item measure of the 10 factors (the Big Five Aspect Scales [BFAS]), which was validated in a 2nd sample (N=480). Finally, the authors examined the correlations of the 10 factors with scores derived from 10 genetic factors that a previous study identified underlying the shared variance among the Revised NEO Personality Inventory facets (K. L. Jang et al., 2002). The correspondence was strong enough to suggest that the 10 aspects of the Big Five may have distinct biological substrates.},

Comparison of two instruments, the Big Five Inventory and the Mini-Markers, supported the hypotheses that single-adjective rating instruments are likely to yield lower interrater agreement than phrase rating instruments and that lower interrater agreement is associated with weaker correlations among the Big Five and a less coherent higher-order factor structure.

The PVQ-RR reliably measured 15 of the 19 values in the vast majority of groups and two others in most groups. The fit of the theory-based measurement models supported the differentiation of almost all values in every cultural group. Almost all values were measured invariantly across groups at the configural and metric level. A multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that the PVQ-RR perfectly reproduced the theorized order of the 19 values around the circle across groups. The current study established the PVQ-RR as a sound instrument to measure and to compare the hierarchies and correlates of values across cultures.},

To present Dante's ideas about the cosmos, or God, or salvation, or history, or poetry within the context of post-Enlightenment presuppositions, as is usually done, is thus to capture only imperfectly the essence of those ideas. This book argues that the recovery of Dante's metaphysics is essential if we are to resolve what has been called “the central problem in the interpretation of the Comedy. ”That problem is what to make of the Comedy's claim to the “status of revelation, vision, or experiential record — as something more than imaginative literature.” This book offers a sustained treatment of the metaphysical picture that grounds and motivates the Comedy, and of the relation between those metaphysics and Dante's poetics. The book carries this out through an examination of three notoriously complex cantos of the Paradiso, read against the background of the Neoplatonic and Aristotelian tradition from which they arise.},

This study examined the structure of the DT domains, both independently and as a cluster. Initial results were replicated with a validation sample. Participants (Study 1: N = 301; Study 2: N = 224) completed six self-report questionnaires that assess DT domains. Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) was used in a two-step process to identify lower order facets and higher order factors of the DT. EGAs suggested eight facets of Narcissism, six facets of Psychopathy, four facets of Machiavellianism, and four DT factors, as grandiose and vulnerable narcissism formed two separate factors. Network analyses highlighted the central role that Antagonism occupied in the DT network. This study provides support for the feasibility of EGA, especially with traits that may be highly correlated, such as personality components. Results highlight the multidimensionality of the DT domains that existing personality measures fail to comprehensively capture, and the need for further research to refine measurement of the DT domains and Machiavellianism in particular.},

Our results showed that the Dark Triad of personality was positively related to utilitarianism and Harm/Care and Honesty/Humility negatively mediated this relationship, revealing that utilitarian inclinations are expressed by a lower concern for the no-harm principle and for prosocial behaviors. Among the Dark Triad, psychopathy appeared to be the only independent predictor of Harm/Care and utilitarianism, suggesting a stronger predictive value of psychopathy in explaining utilitarian judgment.

In regression analyses, Machiavellianism and narcissism were positively associated with the values Achievement and Power, while psychopathy was positively associated with the values Hedonism, and Power. In addition, the Dark Triad traits explained significant variance over the Big Five traits in accounting for individual differences in social values. Differences between the Swedish and the US sample in the social value Achievement was mediated by the Dark Triad traits, as well as age.

	isbn = {978-0-7432-0133-9},
	abstract = {Today considered a landmark of twentieth-century intellectual history, I and Thou is also one of the most important books of Western theology. In it, Martin Buber, heavily influenced by the writings of Frederich Nietzsche, united the proto-Existentialists currents of modern German thought with the Judeo-Christian tradition, powerfully updating faith for modern times. Since its first appearance in German in 1923, this slender volume has become one of the epoch-making works of our time. Not only does it present the best thinking of one of the greatest Jewish minds in centuries, but has helped to mold approaches to reconciling God with the workings of the modern world and the consciousness of its inhabitants.  This work is the centerpiece of Buber's groundbreaking philosophy. It lays out a view of the world in which human beings can enter into relationships using their innermost and whole being to form true partnerships. These deep forms of rapport contrast with those that spring from the Industrial Revolution, namely the common, but basically unethical, treatment of others as objects for our use and the incorrect view of the universe as merely the object of our senses, experiences. Buber goes on to demonstrate how these interhuman meetings are a reflection of the human meeting with God. For Buber, the essence of biblical religion consists in the fact that -- regardless of the infinite abyss between them -- a dialogue between man and God is possible.  Ecumenical in its appeal, I and Thou nevertheless reflects the profound Talmudic tradition from which it has emerged. For Judaism, Buber's writings have been of revolutionary importance. No other writer has so shaken Judaism from parochialism and applied it so relevantly to the problems and concerns of contemporary men. On the other hand, the fundamentalist Protestant movement in this country has appropriated Buber's "I and Thou encounter" as the implicit basis of its doctrine of immediate faith-based salvation. In this light, Martin Buber has been viewed as the Jewish counterpart to Paul Tillich.  This is the original English translation, available in America only in this hardcover edition of I and Thou. Martin Buber considered Ronald Smith's the best of the English translations and it was prepared in the author's presence. The more poetic rendering, this translation can be looked at as the King James Version of Buber's I and Thou.},

	abstract = {Background
This large-scale (N = 1870) replication effort of Fisher et al. (2015) (N = 190) examines associations between the Fisher Type Indicator (FTI) temperament construct and the hierarchical Big5/Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality.
Aim
The original and current studies are among contemporary efforts to link biologically related temperament/personality dimensions with socio-cultural and lexical personality traits. In this context, the current study explores possible links between FFM traits and higher-order personality factors such as the ‘Big Two’ (Stability and Plasticity) and the General Factor of Personality (GFP) and their implications.
Methods
Both studies examine possible associations between four broad neural systems—dopamine and related norepinephrine, serotonin, testosterone, and estrogen/oxytocin and Big5/FFM personality traits. The current sample size is ten times larger (1870 vs. 190) and represents a much broader age distribution (13–82 vs. 20–22) than the original study. Similar statistical procedures were employed to ensure accurate methodological replication.
Results and conclusions
The current study replicated most FTI-FFM associations reported in the original study, thereby lending greater validity to the original findings. Given the current study's larger sample and broader age range, it extended into three other domains: 1. Improved understanding of dopamine-serotonin based meta-traits in the FFM construct and beyond; 2. Consolidated and expanded understanding of gender-related temperament differences; 3. Explore developmental aspects concerning how associations between biological-temperament and socio-cultural FFM personality traits change with age.},

	shorttitle = {Sculpting in {Time}},
	abstract = {Andrey Tarkovsky, the genius of modern Russian cinema—hailed by Ingmar Bergman as \&quot;the most important director of our time\&quot;—died an exile in Paris in December 1986. In Sculpting in Time, he has left his artistic testament, a remarkable revelation of both his life and work. Since Ivan\&\#39;s Childhood won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1962, the visionary quality and totally original and haunting imagery of Tarkovsky\&\#39;s films have captivated serious movie audiences all over the world, who see in his work a continuation of the great literary traditions of nineteenth-century Russia. Many critics have tried to interpret his intensely personal vision, but he himself always remained inaccessible.In Sculpting in Time, Tarkovsky sets down his thoughts and his memories, revealing for the first time the original inspirations for his extraordinary films—Ivan\&\#39;s Childhood, Andrey Rublyov, Solaris, The Mirror, Stalker, Nostalgia, and The Sacrifice. He discusses their history and his methods of work, he explores the many problems of visual creativity, and he sets forth the deeply autobiographical content of part of his oeuvre—most fascinatingly in The Mirror and Nostalgia. The closing chapter on The Sacrifice, dictated in the last weeks of Tarkovsky\&\#39;s life, makes the book essential reading for those who already know or who are just discovering his magnificent work.},

	isbn = {978-0-471-81033-9},
	abstract = {The object of much experimentation is to find out how a number of experimental variables, such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc., affect a response, such as yield, and, in particular, to find experimentally the optimal combination of conditions that provides the highest response.  "Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces" shows how to do this efficiently. Written by two practitioners and active researchers who are in the forefront of their field, the book begins from first principles and logically develops basic ideas, finally moving to a discussion of important research findings.  Numerous exercises are included; many of these feature real data sets, and all have answers. An extensive bibliography is provided. Features of the book are: [(a)] A detailed analysis and explanation of ridge maxima. This is of great practical importance because it can show alternative sets of near-optimal conditions. [(b)] A practical discussion of the considerations which should motivate the choice of an experimental design. Included is a critique of alphabetic optimality. [(c)] A summary of important results in least squares, together with the geometry necessary to provide intuitive understanding.  The tools and techniques presented in "Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces" are useful to experimenters in many fields of research. Engineers, quality technologists, chemists, physicists, biologists, botanists, agricultural scientists, psychologists, as well as statisticians, will find many things of value within these pages.},

	abstract = {Morality-as-Cooperation (MAC) is the theory that morality is a collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of cooperation recurrent in human social life. MAC uses game theory to identify distinct types of cooperation, and predicts that each will be considered morally relevant, and each will give rise to a distinct moral domain. Here we test MAC's predictions by developing a new self-report measure of morality, the Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q), and comparing its psychometric properties to those of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ). Over four studies, the results support the MAC-Q's seven-factor model of morality, but not the MFQ's five-factor model. Thus MAC emerges as the best available compass with which to explore the moral landscape.},

	abstract = {The Nicomachean Ethics is one of Aristotle’s most widely read and influential works. Ideas central to ethics—that happiness is the end of human endeavor, that moral virtue is formed through action and habituation, and that good action requires prudence—found their most powerful proponent in the person medieval scholars simply called “the Philosopher.” Drawing on their intimate knowledge of Aristotle’s thought, Robert C. Bartlett and Susan D. Collins have produced here an English-language translation of the Ethics that is as remarkably faithful to the original as it is graceful in its rendering.  Aristotle is well known for the precision with which he chooses his words, and in this elegant translation his work has found its ideal match. Bartlett and Collins provide copious notes and a glossary providing context and further explanation for students, as well as an introduction and a substantial interpretive essay that sketch central arguments of the work and the seminal place of Aristotle’s Ethics in his political philosophy as a whole.  The Nicomachean Ethics has engaged the serious interest of readers across centuries and civilizations—of peoples ancient, medieval, and modern; pagan, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish—and this new edition will take its place as the standard English-language translation.},

And what is a human life, if, in every one of its gestures, of its words, and of its silences, it cannot be distinguished from the rule? It is to these questions that Giorgio Agamben’s new book turns by means of an impassioned reading of the phenomenon of Western monasticism from Pachomius to St. Francis. The Highest Poverty meticulously reconstructs the lives of monks, with their obsessive attention to temporal articulation and to the Rule, to ascetic techniques and to liturgy. But Agamben’s thesis is that the true novelty of monasticism lies not in the confusion between life and norm, but in the discovery of a new dimension, in which “life” is affirmed in its autonomy, and in which the claim of the “highest poverty” and “use” challenges the law in ways that we must still grapple with today. How can we think a form-of-life, that is, a human life released from the grip of law, and a use of bodies and of the world that never becomes an appropriation? How can we think life as something not subject to ownership but only for common use?},
