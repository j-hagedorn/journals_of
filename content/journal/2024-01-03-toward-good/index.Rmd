I stand at the threshold.  I peer out from the doorway connecting my small, inner world with the clamorous beauty of Reality: and it makes me *want*.  Seeing the vasts of the world accentuates the gaps within me, filling me with that feeling we have come to call, strangely, *longing*.  "Longing, we say, because desire is full / of endless distances", as Robert Hass tells it.^[In his vulnerable [Meditation at Lagunitas](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47553/meditation-at-lagunitas), which ends with the mantra "*blackberry, blackberry, blackberry*"]

This desire coaxes me to change... something... about myself, my situation.  I know that tiny changes are possible each conscious moment, every time I move through the cycle of sensing, choosing and acting on the world. If I want to be purposeful in shaping this cycle, it certainly helps to have a clear understanding of myself, the patterns of behavior we call traits.  Yet I'm still left with a larger question: What do I want my patterns to change *into*?  Or, put another way: What is at the other end of my longing?


## An inventory of longing

At this point I could jump into my own litany of desires (some wholesome, some not so), but that wouldn't be particularly helpful. Or maybe just assume we all know what's good for us, and should just eat our proverbial broccoli, but that approach glosses over too many of the differences between our views of the world.

Rather than start by considering a small set of pre-defined 'virtues' and harboring a suspicion that something is being hidden from us by a morality we don’t share, let's begin by pulling together the broadest set of things that people want, without initially labeling them as either 'good' or 'bad'.^["'*Damn*' braces, '*Bless*' relaxes", advises William Blake.]

A helpful ally in this search for an *inventory of longing* is the research of Shalom Schwartz, whose theory of values provides common terms for a full range of human interests.^[These can include both charitable and selfish ends: because the list is descriptive and not prescriptive, it includes items that have historically been known as 'virtues' and 'vices'.] What I've been calling a desire, or a longing, Schwartz calls a value.  His theory and associated measurement tools^[These include various versions of the *Portrait Value Questionnaire*, including the brief version used the European Social Survey.  See: @schwartzRepositorySchwartzValue2021] have been used across various subsequent psychological studies, which allow us to consider values within discussions about personality traits, group cooperation, and other relevant areas.

__Values are broad goals that guide our lives.__ According to Schwartz,^[@schwartzMeasuringRefinedTheory2022] values are "trans-situational goals, varying in importance, that serve as guiding principles in the life of a person or other social entity."  Individual people can have values, but so can communities, organizations, or other groups. 

Below is the full list of values defined in this model, with simpler terms in the first column which I intend to use throughout the subsequent discussion:^[The shorter name concocted by me is followed by the longer one provided by Schwartz, and the definition drawn directly from [@schwartzMeasuringRefinedTheory2022]]

| Value          | SVS Term                   | Definition         | 
|----------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| Dependability  | Benevolence-Dependability  | Being a reliable and trustworthy member of the in-group | 
| Caring         | Benevolence-Caring         | Devotion to the welfare of in-group members |
| Non-Judgment   | Universalism-Tolerance     | Acceptance and understanding of those who are different from oneself |
| Justice        | Universalism-Concern       | Commitment to equality, justice, and protection for all people |
| Cosmos         | Universalism-Nature        | Preservation of the natural environment |
| Humility       | Humility                   | Recognizing one’s insignificance in the larger scheme of things |
| Restraint      | Conformity-Interpersonal   | Avoidance of upsetting or harming other people |
| Conformity     | Conformity-Rules           | Compliance with rules, laws, and formal obligations |
| Tradition      | Tradition                  | Maintaining and preserving cultural, family, or religious traditions |
| Others' Safety | Security-Societal          | Safety and stability in the wider society |
| Personal Safety| Security-Personal          | Safety in one’s immediate environment |
| Appearance     | Face | Security and power through maintaining one’s public image and avoiding humiliation |
| Resources      | Power-Resources            | Power through control of material and social resources |
| Dominance      | Power-Dominance            | Power through exercising control over people |
| Achievement    | Achievement                | Personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards |
| Pleasure       | Hedonism                   | Pleasure and sensuous gratification for oneself |
| Stimulation    | Stimulation                | Excitement, novelty, and challenge in life |
| Free Action    | Self-Direction-Action      | The freedom to determine one’s own actions |
| Free Thought   | Self-Direction-Thought     | The freedom to cultivate one’s own ideas and abilities |

__These values are related to each other.__  The brilliance of this model is that all values are laid out in a [circular continuum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9131418/figure/fig1-1073191121998760/), so that each blends into the next.  This means that values which are next to each other on the continuum are more highly correlated.  For instance, if you value *conformity* to rules, you are more likely to also value cultural *tradition*.  Values that are opposite each other on the wheel are less related; so that people valuing *conformity* are less likely to value *free action*.

Everything human is here, distilled into the naive simplicity of a diagram: the petty conniving for power, the fear for your children's safety, the striving for freedom, the savoring of wine and chocolate, the rites and celebrations.  It shows the various directions in which we are tugged, and what keeps us awake at night, whether from thrills or fears.  The great loom on which our longings are woven.

__Values shape us as we reach for them.__  *Achievement*, *safety*, *justice*... these are not things that we can attain once and for all, but aspire to.  Their fullness always seems to lie just beyond our reach.  Yet they shape us even now, these visions we reach toward, as the light through the forest canopy shapes a sapling.

__But can we choose what we long for?__  Can we change what we long for and shape ourselves into something new?  If the values arrayed around this circle shade into one another, then it is possible for us to move our affections from one value to another. Perhaps I can choose a different light to lean toward, taking my current jumble of desires and aligning them, re-orienting them.  Do I value being *dependable*, but think that *caring* is a higher calling?^[A quick note on the tools used for the Schwartz Values Scale: Even while filling out the *Portrait Value Questionnaire*, I am aware of at least two ways to read and frame the questions it asks. The tool prompts respondents to "read each description [of an imagined person] and think about how much that person is or is not like you" and then proceeds with a number of statements with the form "It is important to him/her to...".  When filling the questionnaire out, the phrase "it is important to" could mean either that I actively feel and behave as though they are important, or it could imply that I believe it is important for people to do this in general: that the world would be a better place, if we all behaved in such a way. The former reading is helpful for uncovering my shortcomings, while the latter begins to tilt in the direction of virtues.]  Seems like I should re-orient my desires.

## Focus on flourishing

__We need to pare down the list.__  Out of the whole array of values which we could hold, we have to choose some and not others.  After all, many are in tension, or even conflict, with each other (it's hard to value both conformity and free action, for instance).  So if it's possible to choose what we value, how will we make the choice?

__In with the good, out with the bad.__ We can start with a most basic impulse, at the root of everything from our healthcare regimens to our religious rituals: the principle of "in with the good, out with the bad."^[On the subject of religious rituals, Jane Ellen Harrison writes that from the earliest examples, rites have concerned themselves with the "riddance of whatever is conceived to be hostile, and the enhancement of whatever is conceived of as favorable to human life". See: [@harrisonEpilegomenaStudyGreek2017]]  Our goal is to embody what is good and remove what is bad, leaving just good stuff.  I’ll follow Aristotle and call this state "flourishing".

__It has to work for others, too.__

### Remove the bad


### Keep the good
