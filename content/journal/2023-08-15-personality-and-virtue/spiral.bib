	abstract = {The influential work of speculative biology—and a key document in posthumanist studies—now available in a new, accurate English translation.  In A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans, the pioneering biophilosopher Jakob von Uexküll embarks on a remarkable exploration of the unique social and physical environments that individual animal species, as well as individuals within species, build and inhabit. Uexküll’s concept of the umwelt holds new possibilities for the terms of animality, life, and the framework of biopolitics.},
