Play, sex, cuisine, creativity, altruism, pets, grieving rituals, and other oft-neglected topics broaden the scope of this fascinating study. This tract is imbued with historical perspectives that reveal the continuity in the evolving science and research of this discipline over the past century. The author places classic schemas and constructs, as well as current principles, in the context of their socio-political catalysts. He further relates this study of the person to life-span developmental issues and to cultural, gender-specific, trait-based, genetic/epigenetic, and evolutionary research findings. Personality psychology has recently reconciled itself to more modest paradigms for describing, explaining, and predicting human behaviour than it generated in the 19th and 20th centuries. This book documents that transformation, providing valuable information for health-service professionals as well as to teachers, researchers, and scientists.},

These findings indicate the existence of 2 distinct (but correlated) aspects within each of the Big Five, representing an intermediate level of personality structure between facets and domains. The authors characterized these factors in detail at the item level by correlating factor scores with the International Personality Item Pool (L. R. Goldberg, 1999). These correlations allowed the construction of a 100-item measure of the 10 factors (the Big Five Aspect Scales [BFAS]), which was validated in a 2nd sample (N=480). Finally, the authors examined the correlations of the 10 factors with scores derived from 10 genetic factors that a previous study identified underlying the shared variance among the Revised NEO Personality Inventory facets (K. L. Jang et al., 2002). The correspondence was strong enough to suggest that the 10 aspects of the Big Five may have distinct biological substrates.},

To present Dante's ideas about the cosmos, or God, or salvation, or history, or poetry within the context of post-Enlightenment presuppositions, as is usually done, is thus to capture only imperfectly the essence of those ideas. This book argues that the recovery of Dante's metaphysics is essential if we are to resolve what has been called “the central problem in the interpretation of the Comedy. ”That problem is what to make of the Comedy's claim to the “status of revelation, vision, or experiential record — as something more than imaginative literature.” This book offers a sustained treatment of the metaphysical picture that grounds and motivates the Comedy, and of the relation between those metaphysics and Dante's poetics. The book carries this out through an examination of three notoriously complex cantos of the Paradiso, read against the background of the Neoplatonic and Aristotelian tradition from which they arise.},

	abstract = {Today considered a landmark of twentieth-century intellectual history, I and Thou is also one of the most important books of Western theology. In it, Martin Buber, heavily influenced by the writings of Frederich Nietzsche, united the proto-Existentialists currents of modern German thought with the Judeo-Christian tradition, powerfully updating faith for modern times. Since its first appearance in German in 1923, this slender volume has become one of the epoch-making works of our time. Not only does it present the best thinking of one of the greatest Jewish minds in centuries, but has helped to mold approaches to reconciling God with the workings of the modern world and the consciousness of its inhabitants.  This work is the centerpiece of Buber's groundbreaking philosophy. It lays out a view of the world in which human beings can enter into relationships using their innermost and whole being to form true partnerships. These deep forms of rapport contrast with those that spring from the Industrial Revolution, namely the common, but basically unethical, treatment of others as objects for our use and the incorrect view of the universe as merely the object of our senses, experiences. Buber goes on to demonstrate how these interhuman meetings are a reflection of the human meeting with God. For Buber, the essence of biblical religion consists in the fact that -- regardless of the infinite abyss between them -- a dialogue between man and God is possible.  Ecumenical in its appeal, I and Thou nevertheless reflects the profound Talmudic tradition from which it has emerged. For Judaism, Buber's writings have been of revolutionary importance. No other writer has so shaken Judaism from parochialism and applied it so relevantly to the problems and concerns of contemporary men. On the other hand, the fundamentalist Protestant movement in this country has appropriated Buber's "I and Thou encounter" as the implicit basis of its doctrine of immediate faith-based salvation. In this light, Martin Buber has been viewed as the Jewish counterpart to Paul Tillich.  This is the original English translation, available in America only in this hardcover edition of I and Thou. Martin Buber considered Ronald Smith's the best of the English translations and it was prepared in the author's presence. The more poetic rendering, this translation can be looked at as the King James Version of Buber's I and Thou.},

	abstract = {Background
This large-scale (N = 1870) replication effort of Fisher et al. (2015) (N = 190) examines associations between the Fisher Type Indicator (FTI) temperament construct and the hierarchical Big5/Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality.
Aim
The original and current studies are among contemporary efforts to link biologically related temperament/personality dimensions with socio-cultural and lexical personality traits. In this context, the current study explores possible links between FFM traits and higher-order personality factors such as the ‘Big Two’ (Stability and Plasticity) and the General Factor of Personality (GFP) and their implications.
Methods
Both studies examine possible associations between four broad neural systems—dopamine and related norepinephrine, serotonin, testosterone, and estrogen/oxytocin and Big5/FFM personality traits. The current sample size is ten times larger (1870 vs. 190) and represents a much broader age distribution (13–82 vs. 20–22) than the original study. Similar statistical procedures were employed to ensure accurate methodological replication.
Results and conclusions
The current study replicated most FTI-FFM associations reported in the original study, thereby lending greater validity to the original findings. Given the current study's larger sample and broader age range, it extended into three other domains: 1. Improved understanding of dopamine-serotonin based meta-traits in the FFM construct and beyond; 2. Consolidated and expanded understanding of gender-related temperament differences; 3. Explore developmental aspects concerning how associations between biological-temperament and socio-cultural FFM personality traits change with age.},

In Sculpting in Time, he has left his artistic testament, a remarkable revelation of both his life and work. Since Ivan\&\#39;s Childhood won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1962, the visionary quality and totally original and haunting imagery of Tarkovsky\&\#39;s films have captivated serious movie audiences all over the world, who see in his work a continuation of the great literary traditions of nineteenth-century Russia. Many critics have tried to interpret his intensely personal vision, but he himself always remained inaccessible.In Sculpting in Time, Tarkovsky sets down his thoughts and his memories, revealing for the first time the original inspirations for his extraordinary films—Ivan\&\#39;s Childhood, Andrey Rublyov, Solaris, The Mirror, Stalker, Nostalgia, and The Sacrifice. He discusses their history and his methods of work, he explores the many problems of visual creativity, and he sets forth the deeply autobiographical content of part of his oeuvre—most fascinatingly in The Mirror and Nostalgia. The closing chapter on The Sacrifice, dictated in the last weeks of Tarkovsky\&\#39;s life, makes the book essential reading for those who already know or who are just discovering his magnificent work.},

"Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces" shows how to do this efficiently. Written by two practitioners and active researchers who are in the forefront of their field, the book begins from first principles and logically develops basic ideas, finally moving to a discussion of important research findings.  Numerous exercises are included; many of these feature real data sets, and all have answers. An extensive bibliography is provided. Features of the book are: [(a)] A detailed analysis and explanation of ridge maxima. This is of great practical importance because it can show alternative sets of near-optimal conditions. [(b)] A practical discussion of the considerations which should motivate the choice of an experimental design. Included is a critique of alphabetic optimality. [(c)] A summary of important results in least squares, together with the geometry necessary to provide intuitive understanding.  The tools and techniques presented in "Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces" are useful to experimenters in many fields of research. Engineers, quality technologists, chemists, physicists, biologists, botanists, agricultural scientists, psychologists, as well as statisticians, will find many things of value within these pages.},
