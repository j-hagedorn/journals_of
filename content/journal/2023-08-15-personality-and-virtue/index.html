<p>The days revolve. I awake again into myself. I walk the familiar orbit of habits and tensions tracing back to my childhood. To my parents, to their childhoods. And so on. <em>Life is a circle.</em></p>
<p>The days slip away. I will never see yesterday again, and I’m continually tiptoe on the verge of an undiscovered moment. <em>Life is a line.</em></p>
<p>Circle, line: these are partial figures we’ve often fused together to depict our experience, since neither seems adequate by itself. Change is possible, but the new grows from the old. Each adult is formed from the body of a child. Tomorrow I will still be me, but I can unlock the closed cycle of my habits and choose what is good. Recognizable, but transformed. <em>Life is a spiral</em>.</p>
<p>Preparing myself, I shuffle the small deck of questions I’ve nearly worn out with partial answers: <a href="#who-am-i?">Who am I?</a> <a href="#what-do-i-want-to-become?">What do I want to become?</a> <a href="#how-do-i-change-myself?">How do I change myself?</a> There’s no reason to listen to my slow rehearsal, except that the answers are not mine: they’re a playlist of other, lovely voices.</p>

<h3>A Little World in Motion</h3>
<p>“<em>I am a little world made cunningly / Of elements and an angelic sprite</em>” writes John Donne,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> gesturing toward our smallness and our vastness, our physicality and what is intangible in us. Even that intangible part of us seems to be composed of reflections: <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> though there is one reality, we each walk around in our “own worlds” and participate in each others’ “worlds”.</p>
<p>In <em>A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans</em>, <span class="citation">Jakob von Uexküll (<a href="#ref-jakobvonuexkullForayWorldsAnimals">n.d.</a>)</span> describes how the internal world of any organism, including humans, is made up. He names this subjective world an Umwelt (<em>surroundworld</em>) since it is focused outward, created and reshaped by each of us when we interact with reality. This cycle shows how it works in action:</p>
<p><img src="images/umwelt.png" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>The beauty of the Umwelt model is that it explains a lot, and simply. It pares down the bewildering array of experience into two realms: <em>inside</em> of me, and <em>outside</em> of me. In it, all experiences are shown as pathways between the inner world and outer reality: the narrow routes by which we <em>sense</em> the outer world (coming in), and by which we <em>affect</em> it (going out).</p>
<p>This cycle weaving together inner and outer worlds depicts a dance that has been engaged by philosophies and religions across cultures and ages: Atman and Brahman<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, the knower and the known, I and Thou <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-buberThou2000">Buber and Ronald Gregor Smith 2000</a>)</span>, the individual soul and the Empyrean.</p>
