<p>The days revolve. I wake again into myself. I walk the familiar orbit of habits and tensions tracing back to my childhood. To my parents, to their childhoods. And so on. <em>Life is a circle.</em></p>
<p>The days slip away. I will never see yesterday again, and I’m continually tiptoe on the verge of an undiscovered moment. <em>Life is a line.</em></p>
<p>Circle, line: these are partial figures we’ve often fused together to depict our experience, since neither seems adequate by itself. Change is possible, but the new grows from the old. Each adult is formed from the body of a child. Tomorrow I will still be me, but I can unlock the closed cycle of my habits and choose what is good. Recognizable, but transformed. <em>Life is a spiral</em>.</p>
<p>Preparing myself, I shuffle the small deck of questions I’ve nearly worn out with partial answers: <a href="#who">Who am I?</a> <a href="#what">What do I want to become?</a> <a href="#how">How do I change myself?</a> There’s no reason to listen to my slow rehearsal, except that the answers are not mine: they’re a playlist of other, lovely voices.</p>

<h3>A Little World in Motion</h3>
<p>“<em>I am a little world made cunningly / Of elements and an angelic sprite</em>” writes John Donne,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> gesturing toward our smallness and our vastness, our physicality and what is intangible in us. Even that intangible part of us seems to be composed of reflections: <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> though there is one reality, we each walk around in our “own worlds” and participate in each others’ “worlds”.</p>
<p>This cycle weaving together inner and outer worlds depicts a dance that has been engaged by philosophies and religions across cultures and ages: Atman and Brahman<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, the knower and the known, I and Thou,<span class="citation"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> the individual soul and the Empyrean<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It is also founded in our biology, our bodies. In <em>A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans</em>, <span class="citation">Jakob von Uexküll<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> describes how the internal world of any organism, including humans, is made up. He names this subjective world an Umwelt (<em>surroundworld</em>) since it is focused outward, created and reshaped by each of us when we interact with reality. This cycle shows how it works in action:</p>
<p><img src="images/umwelt.png" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>The beauty of the Umwelt model is that it explains a lot, and simply. It pares down the bewildering array of experience into two realms: <em>inside</em> of me, and <em>outside</em> of me. In it, all experiences are shown as pathways between the inner world and outer reality: the narrow routes by which we <em>sense</em> the outer world (coming in), and by which we <em>affect</em> it (going out).</p>
<p>Staggering and complex as our experiences are, they move through us along this pathway. But the path is not a closed circle, endlessly playing the same loop over and over again: it’s a spiral. The world changes, and calls me to change. Sunsets may be the same as when I was a kid, but I <em>sense</em> them differently. I change myself, and even the vast world, a little bit at a time.</p>
<p>The spiral, that elegant fusion of circle and line, acknowledges repetition while allowing transformation. And it’s worth noting that I can change for better or for worse, which we acknowledge when we talk about a <em>vicious cycle</em> (or its more recent sibling, the <em>virtuous cycle</em>).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> A spiral is vicious when it closes me off into an inner world which becomes antagonistic to others. It is virtuous when it beckons me out to gather and learn from the world beyond, in order to share with others.</p>
<p>The world rushes in and I have a choice, moment-by-moment, day-after-day. If a little change is possible each time I move through this cycle, then a question presents itself: what is the shape I want to make?</p>
<p>As a prelude to answering that question, it may help to look around and ask: what are some of the the shapes that people trace as they experience the world, make choices, and act on them?</p>
<!-- I am not a closed loop.  Everything that I experience (each kiss, each poem, each peach) is just a segment of a fuller circle: each of my actions a gesture out into an immense world.   And the world is too great for me to control (*thus the diagram's dotted lines*), so that just to exist requires much going right (luck, fortune, or grace, whatever one calls it).  A person cannot be walled off, so we are continually vulnerable: open to the world outside ourselves and depending on it.   -->

<h3>Same Difference</h3>
<p>No one else has the same story as me. Down to the spelling of my genetic code, I’m unique. But others’ stories resonate with me. Even my body is written with the same language as yours: we’re the same.</p>
<p>The collection of traits that my family, friends and colleagues recognize as ‘me’ describe patterns of interactions they’ve had with me. Those patterns are the various ways that I interact with the world, and they’re basically my unique remix of the kinds of interactions that others have with the world.</p>
<p>Over time, people have attempted to classify the ways in which humans interact with the world, from the ancient models of the <em>four humors</em><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> or the <em>triguna</em><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> to modern neuropsychology. One of the more recent versions of this effort has resulted in trait models of personality. <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> A trait is a repeated pattern which guides how a person interprets the flow of sensations and reacts to them. For example, if I typically react to the flow of sensations from a crowded party with enthusiasm, I’m engaging a trait that we call <em>extraversion</em>. If I shy away from asserting myself at the party, I’m exhibiting the flipside of that trait (i.e. <em>introversion</em>).</p>
<p><img src="images/umwelt_party.png" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>Beginning with the available stock of phrases available in our speech and writing, researchers have tested whether the various descriptions we apply to each other can be distilled to a handful of common traits transcending cultures and languages. This way, descriptions such as “she is dutiful” and “she is diligent” and “she is detail-oriented” could all be seen as pointing to an underlying character trait of “conscientiousness.” These researchers have found five or maybe six basic dimensions which explain the incredible variety of personalities that we encounter in others.</p>
<p>If these ‘word-based’ attributes point to something real about us, it would be strange if we could not trace their presence within the fabric of our bodies. And so we have dug deeper, and neurological studies of the brain have found relationships between our longstanding descriptions of ourselves, and the material structures of our bodies: the brain and the nerves that weave our bodies together.</p>
