The days revolve.  I wake again into myself.  I walk the familiar orbit of habits and tensions tracing back to my childhood.  To my parents, to their childhoods. And so on.  *Life is a circle.*  
    
The days slip away.  I will never see yesterday again, and I'm continually tiptoe on the verge of another undiscovered moment.  *Life is a line.*  
    
Circle, line: these are partial figures we've often fused together to depict our experience, since neither seems adequate by itself.  Change is possible, but the new grows from the old.  Each adult is formed from the body of a child.  Tomorrow I will still be me, but I can unlock the closed cycle of my habits and choose what is good.  Recognizable, but transformed. *Life is a spiral*.
    
Preparing myself, I shuffle the small deck of questions I've nearly worn out with partial answers:  [Who am I?](#who) [What do I want to become?](#what) [How do I change myself?](#how)  There's no reason to listen to my slow rehearsal, except that the answers are not mine: they're a playlist of other voices' music.

<!-- What do those voices say?  THESIS. -->

## Who am I? {#who}

### A Little World in Motion

"*I am a little world made cunningly / Of elements and an angelic sprite*" writes John Donne,^[See [Holy Sonnet 5](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44108/holy-sonnets-i-am-a-little-world-made-cunningly)] gesturing toward our smallness and our vastness, our physicality and what is intangible in us.  Even that intangible part of us seems to be composed of reflections: ^[As one of Donne's contemporaries notes, the "*mind a mirror is of heavenly sights, / A brief wherein all marvels summed lie*".  See [Look Home](https://www.poetry.com/poem/31924/look-home) by Robert Southwell.] though there is one reality, we each walk around in our "own worlds" and participate in each others' "worlds".  

Our daily round, circulating between inner and outer worlds, depicts a dance that has been engaged by philosophies and religions across cultures and ages: Atman and Brahman^[अयम् आत्मा ब्रह्म
*ayam ātmā brahma*, roughly translated "the self is connected to the deep foundation of reality", from the [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5](https://archive.org/details/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda/page/712/mode/2up). The Upanishads also include the notion that all creatures are connected to this deep foundation, (सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म, *sarvam* *khalvidam* *brahma*), see [Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.1](https://archive.org/details/upanishads01ml/page/48/mode/2up)], the knower and the known, I and Thou [@buberThou2000], the individual soul and the Empyrean^[For Dante, entering heaven can be seen as approaching this unity between self and other: "*In this flash of insight, all “I”s are one: each is everything and nothing. This was the revelation experienced by Moses on Mount Sinai, which prompted him to tell the Israelites: “I AM sent me to you.”*". [@moevsMetaphysicsDanteComedy2005], p. 31].

It is also founded in our biology, our bodies.  In *A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans*, @jakobvonuexkullForayWorldsAnimals2010 describes how the internal world of any organism, including humans, is made up.  He names this subjective world an Umwelt (*surroundworld*) since it is focused outward, created and reshaped by each of us when we interact with reality. A simple picture shows how it works in action:

![](images/umwelt.png){width=80%}

__Each person unites the inner and outer world.__  The beauty of the Umwelt model is that it explains a lot, and simply. It pares down the bewildering array of experience into two realms: *inside* of me, and *outside* of me. In it, all experiences are shown as pathways between the inner world and outer reality: the narrow routes by which we *sense* the outer world (coming in), and by which we *affect* it (going out).

__We grow in place, within limits.__  Staggering and complex as our experiences are, they move through us along this pathway.  But the path is not a closed circle, endlessly playing the same loop over and over again: it's a spiral.  The world changes, and calls me to change.  Sunsets may be the same as when I was a kid, but I *sense* them differently.  I change myself, and even the vast world, a little bit at a time.

__We can grow into beauty, or diminish.__  The spiral, that elegant fusion of circle and line, acknowledges repetition while allowing transformation.  And it's worth noting that I can change for better or for worse, which we acknowledge when we talk about a *vicious cycle* (or its more recent sibling, the *virtuous cycle*).^[While it seems that early usage of 'vitious cycle' goes [back to 1608](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/375811/origin-of-vicious-circle-and-vicious-cycle), both terms began to be used more widely only in the 20th century, [according to Google Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=virtuous+cycle%2Cvicious+cycle&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=0)]  A spiral is vicious when it closes me off into an inner world which becomes antagonistic to others.  It is virtuous when it beckons me out to gather and learn from the world beyond, in order to share with others.

__I have a choice of how I grow.__  The world rushes in and I have a choice, moment-by-moment, day-after-day.  If a little change is possible each time I move through this cycle, then a question presents itself: what is the shape I want to make?  

What are some of the the shapes that other people trace as they experience the world, make choices, and act on them?

<!-- I am not a closed loop.  Everything that I experience (each kiss, each poem, each peach) is just a segment of a fuller circle: each of my actions a gesture out into an immense world.   And the world is too great for me to control (*thus the diagram's dotted lines*), so that just to exist requires much going right (luck, fortune, or grace, whatever one calls it).  A person cannot be walled off, so we are continually vulnerable: open to the world outside ourselves and depending on it.   -->

### Same Difference
  
No one else has the same story as me.  Down to the spelling of my genetic code, I'm unique.  But others' stories resonate with me.  Even my body is written with the same language as yours: we're the same.

The collection of traits that my family, friends and colleagues recognize as 'me' describe patterns of interactions they've had with me.  Those patterns are the various ways that I interact with the world, and they're basically my unique remix of the kinds of interactions that others have with the world.

Over time, people have classified the ways in which humans interact with the world, from the ancient models of the *four humors*^[Echoes of this model come down into modern science, as in the work of Hans Eysenck (1916–97). "If one crosses Eysenck’s extroversion–introversion dimension with the emotional stability emotional lability dimension, four cells emerge that correspond to the Greek model of Hippocrates and Galen", according to @dumontHistoryPersonalityPsychology2010] or the *triguna*^[For a crosswalk of Indian Ayurvedic models and modern psychology, see: @srivastavaConceptPersonalityIndian2012] to modern neuropsychology.  One of the more recent versions of this effort has resulted in trait models of personality. ^[See [@dumontHistoryPersonalityPsychology2010], p. 150]  A trait is a repeated pattern which guides how you interpret the flow of sensations and react to them.  For example, if you typically react to the flow of sensations from a crowded party with enthusiasm, you're engaging a trait we call *extroversion*.  If you shy away from asserting yourself at the party, you're exhibiting the flip side of that trait (i.e. *introversion*).

<!-- ![](images/umwelt_party.png){width=80%} -->

Beginning with the available stock of phrases available in our speech and writing, researchers have investigated whether the various descriptions we apply to each other can be distilled to a handful of common traits transcending cultures and languages.  This way, descriptions such as "she is dutiful" and "she is diligent" and "she is detail-oriented" might all be seen as pointing to an underlying character trait of "conscientiousness."  

Generations of researchers have located five or maybe six basic dimensions which explain the incredible variety of personalities that we encounter in others.^[The two most popular trait models are known as the Five-Factor Model (FFM) and HEXACO.  The FFM uses the acronym OCEAN as a mnemmonic for the traits: *Openness to Experience*, *Conscientiousness*, *Extroversion*, *Agreeableness*, and *Neuroticism*.  HEXACO itself is an acronym, and adds an additional trait of *Honesty-Humility* to the other five, which it renames as: *Emotionality*, *eXtroversion*, *Agreeableness* (versus Anger), *Conscientiousness*, and *Openness to Experience*.]  Of course people are intricate, layering traits and weaving them to produce different resonances. Even more, these braided traits interact with different environments in different ways, leading to an infinite flowering of distinct persons. Each person is unique, yes, but our differences can be plotted across the same few dimensions, just as the plenitude of giraffes, tsunamis, books, and radiolarians all live within four observable dimensions of time and space. 

Of course, if our words point to something real about us, it would be strange if we couldn't trace the presence of these attributes within the fabric of our bodies. As we have delved deeper, neurological studies [@alkalayBiologicalBasisFFM2022] have discovered relationships between our longstanding descriptions of ourselves, and the material 'stuff' of our bodies: the brain and other nerves that weave us together.

Distilling personality traits all the way down, we find two basic tendencies: *stability* and *plasticity*.^[For the original study deriving these meta-traits from a community survey, see: [@deyoungHigherorderFactorsBig2006]. Later studies such as [@alkalayBiologicalBasisFFM2022], indicate that *stability* is based in the FTI Serotonin system (i.e. cautious/norm compliant), while *plasticity* is based in the dopamine and related norepinephrine system (i.e. curious/energetic).] A motion which holds us together, and a motion that impels us to explore the world.  A circle and a line.

![](images/factors.png){width=80%}

The table above shows how these two tendencies play out across the five factors of personality, as well as the essential aspects [@deyoungFacetsDomains102007] which comprise those factors.  There are many more descriptions clustered under each of these, but this list gives a sense of the space in which our temperaments situate themselves.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# https://ipip.ori.org/newIndexofScaleLabels.htm

traits <- read_excel("data/TedoneItemAssignmentTable30APR21.xlsx") 

factors <- traits %>% filter(instrument == "NEO5-20")

tst <-
  factors %>%
  select(text, factor = label, key) %>%
  left_join(
    traits %>% 
      filter(instrument != "NEO5-20") %>% 
      select(text, aspect = label),
    by = "text"
  ) %>%
  filter(key == 1)

# Stack df and present as sunburst/treemp

```

Keep in mind that the terms used here are fleeting, although they point to a more durable structure that underlies human persons. The accuracy of a specific word erodes as quickly as language and culture changes,^[See [@dumontHistoryPersonalityPsychology2010], p. 346: "we can never be certain what a specific hypothetical construct means, as it is always in evolution... Whenever a society has difficulty describing what is signified by the semantic label for a construct (say, love, or curiosity, or honesty) developing a measure for it is challenging."] and the specific labels used for these factors were plucked from a large array of similar terms.^[[@dumontHistoryPersonalityPsychology2010], p. 177, states that different "researchers have chosen other terms to characterize... factors. Because each higher order factor is extracted from representations of numerous traits that have more specificity than the factor does, we are faced with a problem of nomenclature. It is not a simple matter to choose a name for a factor that neither over-specifies that factor nor privileges one aspect of the dimension more than other more important aspects of it."]  For that reason, it is helpful to understand the types of descriptions which underlie these higher level factors. Having a small set of shared terms is helpful to guide our discussion, but we need to remember that "a map is not the territory"^[See Korzybski's [Science and Sanity](http://esgs.free.fr/uk/art/sands-sup3.pdf)], and reality cannot be reduced to the words and tools we use to approximate it.

### Traits as Tools

__I am not reducible to my traits.__  A downside of thinking about oneself as a bundle of traits is that it gives a false sense that these are fixed: that these traits "identify" me, or "add up to" me, rather than describing patterns of my interactions with the world.  We may take some comfort in being part of a group, but this consolation can justify us in forming sects, dividing us unnecessarily from others.  "*Extroverts can't don't understand us: they're just wired differently.*"  Similarly, a trait can easily become an excuse, if we see it as inflexible: "*I couldn't possibly talk to that suffering person, I'm an introvert.*" 

__It's more helpful to think of personality traits as tools for navigating one's relationship with the world.__^[This is similar to the approach taken by the [StrengthsFinder](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253715/34-cliftonstrengths-themes.aspx) system, though that approach urges people to "focus on their strengths" rather than having to endure the pain of refining their weaknesses.  That is to say, it is a tool for business, not for self-transformation.]  Each trait shapes our sense of the world, and provides us with tools to impact our environment.  And we combine each trait with others, to form a comprehensive, complementary approach to the shifting situations we find ourselves in.^[Systems like the Enneagram or the Myers-Briggs try to find a single label which distills a person's characteristics into a type by combining multiple traits into a single label.]

```{r make_gif, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(gifski)
png_files <- c("images/umwelt_agreeable.png","images/umwelt_openness.png","images/umwelt_extraversion.png")
gifski(png_files, gif_file = "images/umwelt_traits.gif", width = 800, height = 600, delay = 10)
```

![](images/umwelt_traits.gif){width=80%}

__Our tools shape us in return.__  Sensing the world in a way which is compassionate or curious engraves a particular shape in us.^[In the diagrams shown here you can see specific items from the [International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)](https://ipip.ori.org/index.htm) which are associated with the traits of agreeableness, open mindedness, and extroversion.  These are mapped to the specific steps in the functional circle of the Umwelt: sensing, choosing, effecting.]  That engraved pattern, in turn, disposes us to see the world in certain ways: *hopeful*, *manipulative*, *compassionate*, etc. Once the pattern is engraved, it is self-reinforcing, so we must purposefully guide our traits, changing their course as needed.
