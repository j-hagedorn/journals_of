### First Fruits

How deeply are the roots of knowing and bodily being entwined?  To investigate, ask: "*What am I without my thoughts?*"  

Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" places a giant equals sign between thinking and being.  This formulation has had visceral consequences, including the dehumanization of individuals with lower *IQ scores* and even the forced sterility and extermination campaigns of the early 20th century, in both the United States and fascist Europe.  Reflecting on the effects of these in his essay "Learning from the Tyrants", E.M. Cioran depicts Hitler as: 

> "*..important not so much in himself as in what he heralds, the rough draft of our future... precursor of that grand-scale despot who will succeed in unifying the world by science, destined not to deliver but to enslave us.  This was understood long ago, it will be understood again one day.  We are born to exist, not to know; to be, not to assert ourselves.  Knowledge, having irritated and stimulated our appetite for power, will lead us inexorably to our ruin.  It is Genesis, not our dreams and our systems, that has perceived our condition.*"^[Cioran, E.M. "Learning from the Tyrants." *History and Utopia.* trans. Richard Howard. University of Chicago Press, 1987.]

By revisiting this story, the Genesis myth from the West's collective childhood, we might even now perceive our condition.  Cioran reads the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" from the Genesis myth not as a moral trespass, but as opening up a deluge of both truth and the turning away from truth, of good and its twisting. Similarly, theologians from early antiquity interpret knowledge not as something prohibited, but as something requiring wisdom if we are to be inoculated against its danger.

Each time we partake of knowledge, we eat again from that primordial tree.  Each headline, each poem, every book and piece of click-bait.  Exposing ourselves to both good and evil, yet barely able to differentiate between them any longer, cross-bred as they have been over so many successive generations.  The tree of knowledge mingles good and evil without providing any ability to distinguish them.  Partaking of this knowledge, one moves from a curated version of the world (*the garden*) to the unfiltered world (*the forest/wilderness*): an image reflecting our condition as children, arising into the confusion of the world, and as parents preparing children to move into the uncurated wilderness.

Yet it is not merely the content of knowledge which is true or false; the issue is not that some false ideas got mixed in with the true ones.  It is knowledge itself which creates an inauthentic relationship of the person to the world.  The paragraphs which you traversed to arrive at this sentence contain views of the world which are blurred by the motion of cadence and obscured through the false familiarity of idiom. It is the medium through which we see, a veil.

This metaphor of a veil, as used in both Christian^[cf. St. Ephrem's *Hymns on Paradise*, where he depicts Eden as parallel to the Temple, and the tree of knowledge as parallel to the veil before the Holy of Holies] and Hindu^[cf. the concept of the *veil of Maya*, which is the illusion that world which appears to us is alone the truth] tradition, shows how our limited knowledge functions. A veil is a fine mesh which allows for visibility: yet it creates a grid which is laid over the world and shapes our perception of it.  The veil also enables certain kinds of apprehension, since it allows us to view bright sunlit scenes by reducing glare, which is outside of our perceptual range.

It is the placing of this phantasm over the beautiful body of the world which expels us from the garden.  Even before the fiery seraphim is placed at the gate to bar them from re-entry, knowledge has placed a gauze between these primordial humans and the world around them.  Recovering paradise does not merely consist of sorting all of the `TRUE` and `FALSE`, or `GOOD` and `EVIL`, notions into the correct bins.  I must pierce the fog of my own thoughts to encounter Reality, to stand in the presence of beauty.  As Milosz writes:^[Milosz, Czeslaw.  "One More Day". *Unnattainable Earth*. trans. Robert Hass.  Harper Collins, 1986.]

> And though the good is weak, beauty is very strong.  
Nonbeing sprawls, everywhere it turns into ash whole expanses of being,  
It masquerades in shapes and colors that imitate existence  
And no one would know it, if they did not know that it was ugly.  
  
> And when people cease to believe that there is good and evil  
Only beauty will call to them and save them  
So that they still know how to say: this is true and that is false.  

This is why, incidentally, poetry heals us more than an essay can.  It foregrounds and allows us to experience the bodily reality of words: the arc of a font, this miniature forest of letters, the scent which ripens in them, a hint of a world within the material, of ink twirled to evaporate from the tongue.

### Designing the Placental Garden

Comparing false knowledge to a 'disease state' allows us to seek a remedy. It also grounds the issue in the tangible world and not the slippery realm of ideas and fictions. (In this regard, the myth of Genesis provides more guidance than the Greek myth of Pandora’s box, which leaves us only with a vague 'hope' once the myriad chimeras are loosed upon the world).

  - Knowledge is messy.  Efforts of last century to provide structure (info theory, library categorization, www) 
  - these efforts superficial. open any web page or book and experience the tangle.  Yet a convincing illusion.
  - Any attempt to structure knowledge presumes a total knowledge of what the total structure is. (cf. Thompson motif index running out of spaces) 
    - Imposing on the collective human imagination a totalizing architecture, like the fascist throroughfares imposed on Rome or Paris' city planning, creates the illusion of a grand order (as opposed to a local symmetry, which is actually the structure of the universe)
      - Compare C. Alexander, designing person-centered and traditional towns...
    - It is telling that no universal language has taken off and started to be used, hinting that there is not a clean symbolic overlay that can be placed above reality.  See: Umberto Eco's "Serendipities"

In an exercise whose futility underscores our inter-relationship with this dataome, Scharf's essay estimates that "the simple act of human arms raising and lowering copies of Shakespeare’s writings has expended well over 4 trillion Joules of energy...equivalent to combusting several hundred thousand kilograms of coal."  There is an outsized physical toll to symbols, however light and compact they may seem.  This recognition, and the even more sizable energy consumption of cat pictures, pornography, and accounting software, leads easily to the question: how might we trim down the size of our data-ome to ensure the survival of what is best in it?

While it's easy to see how a collective body benefits from certain thoughts or writings (e.g. those which espouse kindness as opposed to greed), each individual person often needs some latitude to discover what is a valuable on their own, and needs access to many other shared experiences in order to test, iterate, and discover what works.  Top-down attempts to curb individual contributions to the data-ome, typically referred to as censorship, risk being implemented based on power interests which would skew knowledge in the favor of a select minority and inadvertently reduce the value which transcribing our thoughts has for us as a people. 

### Personal Measures
  - While control of a total structure is alluringly impossible, personal uses of knowledge (i.e. virus control, medicinal) are possible
  - We can control the degree to which we expose ourselves to, and spread, knowledge. Cf. disease management
  - We can control the degree to which we ingest thoughts, as in meditation or nepsis. Cf. slow food, dieting
    - Not out of fear, but a healthy respect for the power of ideas.  Our structures teach that 'more is better' (e.g. moving from G-PG-R in movies), yet this is more a consumerist mindset than reflective of wisdom.
    - Words/knowledge/culture are not Reality, and ingesting them is not truly fulfilling.  Like hugging a mirror.
  - "It is best to have no thoughts at all." - St. Isaak
    - Appears to fly straight in the face of dogmatists whose lexicon is words and thoughts, used to instruct yet so often also to divide/persecute.
    - Wisest seem to use thoughts as a dissolving ladder, which evaporates as one moves up it.  For God is in the air, and ground, and all.

Disease prevention models include the opportunity for action at both a systemic and individual level.  Confronted with this staggering weight, and the increasing proportion of it which is devoted to the informational equivalent of junk food, Scharf feels impelled to impose informational dietary restrictions, making the case that: "*improving the utility of our data, purging it of energy-wasting junk might not be popular, but could perhaps be incentivized... In that case, the human-dataome symbiosis might become the only example in nature of a symbiotic relationship that is consciously managed by one party.*"  While he identifies opportunities for systemic management of the dataome, such proposals face (as he notes) some steep barriers to adoption. [Clarify disagreement with Scharf here]

On the other hand, the individual method of transmission for this particular virus is surprisingly well-documented.  It has been traversed for centuries by ascetics, who have thankfully documented their struggles to overcome their thoughts.

One of the most cogent of these is Nil Sorsky, whose slim collected writings were recently gifted to me.  A Russian hermit of the 14th century, St. Nil identifies five steps which bring one from entertaining an idea to becoming a host organism for that idea. It's phases, albeit by analogy, mirror fairly closely the stages of a virus: 

**Stages of thought** | Description               | **Stages of virus**  | Description of lytic cycle
--------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------
*Suggestion*          | Exposure to thought       | *Exposure*           |   
*Dialogue*            | Interaction with thought  | *Attachment*         | Bacteriophage attaches to surface  
*Consent*             | Acceptance / yielding     | *Penetration*        | Viral DNA enters host  
*Captive*             | Preoccupied / multiplying | *Biosynthesis*       | Phage DNA replicates  
*Passion*             | Thought fuses w/ identity | *Maturation / Lysis* | Cell releases new phages

Bacteria/Virus.  Bacterial when in balance with host, symbiosis.  Viral when false (lacking life/DNA)

Marketing measures of engagement and click-through rates are essentially measures of contagion.

Implementing such a disease reduction strategy would be a life's work, and has been for the ascetics who have undertaken it. It is also made difficult by the fact that not all ideas are only true, and that some do provide nourishment. In this regard the attempt is much like that of individuals who are addicted to food, and who therefore must daily face and ingest the substance which is a psychological poison to them.

Because of this, Saint Isaac the Syrian cautions that "having no thoughts is better than having good thoughts."


### Communal Garden: A Local Approach to Preserving Meaning

  - There is a middle point between total, impersonal control and individual ascesis.  This includes personal interactions, like reading poems to another person, talking about life, etc.
  - Tending a collective garden is the work of a gardener.  The librarian-gardener test the pH, keeps a mix of compost, plants synergistic plants beside one another.  Is selective in what is shared.  Lovingly tends.
