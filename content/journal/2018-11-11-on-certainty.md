There is a vast difference between not meaning what I say, and saying something contrary to what I mean.  In the first case I lack certainty; in the second I have certainty but do not share it.

The first are the inhabitants of Limbo, the "train of souls, so long..." that Dante sees mulling about hell's gates, and Eliot witnesses on the daily commute across London Bridge,^[see *Inferno 3.46*, *Burial of the Dead l. 63*] common enough to include, on many days, me.

The second are the Liars, denizens of a more remote darkness: false counselors, politicians, betrayers, marketing executives.  Dante finds them approaching the center of the pit.

Such an apparently small distinction (*not meaning what I say vs. speaking contrary to what I mean*), such a vast gap.  And the difference lies in a single element: certainty.

We in Limbo explain our motives with stories which have the air of a myth that has been studied, made routine and institutionalized: the Ragnarök [of Marvel Studios](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/) rather than the Ragnarök of the Völuspá's harrowed poet, starving amid a [volcanic winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k#Volcanic_eruptions).  We speak of the dance's context, choreography, etc., yet we do not dance.^[The liar orchestrates the dance, but believes in the power which this orchestration gives him; not in the dance itself.]

We can hold up our stories like a beaded timeline, strung from one end to another.  We can mark the turns, climax, resolution; yet in order to do this we must stand outside the story and it ceases to be ours.  It becomes a museum-piece: remarkable yet unbelievable.^[This is an aftermath of the death of tradition as the hands of history, the replacement of cyclical with linear time.  For if time is linear, then one can only ever look backward at a separate story, from which one is cut off.  If time is circular, we tread and re-tread it.  If spiral, it most forward but with themes woven in and out.]

Uncertainty is not the same as humility.  Humility concedes that one can only occupy one place and one focus at one time. It entails that we acknowledge ourselves as partial, guttering out unless we join others.  "I am partial to..." retains this flavor of taste as peculiar yet firmly held.  To be certain is to embrace being partial.  And even that word, *partial*, holds the promise of connection, and thus of escape from mere solipsism.

It has to do with closeness - pressing one's face into a view, standing so close to the static that we are certain the world is black or white.

The world is not grey, but granular, sifting black and white.  Uncertainty seeks a disembodied, broader view, and then laments that it is blurry.

Certainty pursues ardor before order: it is an embrace of finitude, yet so focused on its object that it does not seek to systematize.

Each day we are becoming more and more precise, more and more certain, regarding our uncertainty. Faltering far from perfect knowledge, we are engraving a monument to our ignorance, etching ever more finely our limits, squinting to mark the finest filigreed detail. A temple to our inability to be gods.  A temple which, for all of its attention to the material, can never be inhabited by life.



Between the person who does not believe what they say and the person who lies: the first has a low view of the truth, A numbed sense of reality, wow the second it’s out of fear, the fear that there is not enough for both of us, and that I must disassemble in order to obtain power, vet power is more important than truth.

If we have believed that there was enough world for each of us, there would be no need for lying.

If we quenched our desires, there would be no need for lying. Or if we spread out our desires more broadly, fell in love with the leaf and sidewalk slush and dust in the corners.  There will be no need for lying if we did not attribute value to scarcity.

And if Satan is the great liar, perhaps his lie is based on this fundamental misconception: that God‘s goodness is not distributed equally everywhere and to everyone.

And that is this which allows us to rest and our partial but enamored certainty: the beauty and absolute Ness of a corner.

Certainteed is not correct Nas. It is, perhaps, to a tribute to write his partial and near at hand the weight of what is absolute colon or because we do not have the strength to confer the weight of the absolute, merely the weight of our hall available will. To inhabit a thought or gaze or attentive Nas with all of our self. 

Certainty as kindred to presence.

We think of the Italian *certo*, which is often used similarly to the word *sure*: as in 'sure-footed', or balanced upon what is here.

We have been taught that the Absolute is distant, that truer means farther.

To become certain, suffused with the thing which one gives oneself to, is to become camouflaged: the background of the story showing through so that one's self is hardly seen at all, except as a part of that scenery.
