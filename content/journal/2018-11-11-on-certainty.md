### The Lukewarm, the Liars

There is a difference between not meaning what I say, and saying something contrary to what I mean.  This apparently small distinction in terms (*not meaning what I say vs. speaking contrary to what I mean*), yields a widely different result.  And the difference lies in a single element: certainty.  This single characteristic sorts the insincere from liars, the lukewarm from the cold-hearted.  In the first case one lacks certainty; in the second case one has certainty but does not share it.

The first are the inhabitants of Limbo, that "train of souls, so long..." which Dante encounters mulling about hell's gates, and which Eliot witnesses on the daily commute across London Bridge.^[see Dante's *Inferno 3.46*, Eliot's *Burial of the Dead l. 63*]  A crowd large enough to include, on many days, me.

The second are the Liars, denizens of a more remote darkness: false counselors, politicians, betrayers, marketing executives.  Dante finds them approaching the central funnel of Hell, and even at the epicenter, where Satan chomps perpetually on one who used a kiss to mask a killing.

The liar acts out of a fear that there is not enough for both of us.  If I must dissemble in order to control, then power is truer than truth.

### In Limbo our myths are fictions

In Limbo our words dissolve in our mouths.  We explain our motives with textbook myths: stories made routine, institutional, and tame. The Ragnarök [of Marvel Studios](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/) rather than the Ragnarök of the Völuspá's harrowed poet, starving amid a [volcanic winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k#Volcanic_eruptions).  

In parallel to the Greek word for the act of *liturgy*, which means the "work of the people"^[The Greek λειτουργία (leitourgía) derives from λειτ- (leit-, from 'people') and -ουργός (-ourgós, from 'work')], Jane Harrison recounts that "among the Tarahumares of Mexico the word *nolavoa* means both 'to work' and 'to dance'" and that rather than betraying a sentimentality for the past, this participation in a collective story made one more fully present.  In fact, she relates that "in extreme old age [a man] ceases to exist, because he cannot dance; his dance, and with it his social status, passes to another and a younger."^[Harrison, J. E.  Ancient Art and Ritual. New York: H. Holt & Co. 1913. p. 31]  

In Limbo we talk about the dance's context, choreography, etc.  We do not, however, dance.  We can hold up our stories like a beaded timeline, strung from one end to another like books on a shelf or in a digitized collection.  We can mark the turns, climax, resolution; yet in order to do this we stand outside the story and it ceases to be ours.  It becomes a museum-piece: remarkable yet unbelievable.^[This is an aftermath of the death of tradition as the hands of history, the replacement of cyclical with linear time.  After all, if time is linear we can only look backward at our stories, and we are irrevocably cut off from them.  If time is circular, we tread and re-tread it.  If spiral, our story proceeds but with themes woven in and out.]

The liar may orchestrate the dance or even dance himself, but he believes in the power which this act gives him; not in the dance itself.


### A humble certainty

Surrounded by marketing and punditry, we might be forgiven for thinking that 'certainty' involves the use of words for either manipulation or weaponization.  A gleaming-toothed money-back guarantee.  A manifest destiny.  Limbo dwellers crave certainty, and liars throughout history have been all too willing to offer it.

We may be tempted by our suspicion to make the inverse mistake as well, but *un*-certainty is not the same as humility.  Humility concedes that one can only occupy one place and one focus at one time. One puts one's full weight into each step of the dance.  Humility entails that we acknowledge ourselves as partial, guttering out unless we join others.  The phrase "I'm partial to..." retains this flavor: of one's taste as tangible, peculiar and firmly held.  

To be certain is to embrace being partial.  Even the word, *partial*, holds the promise of a greater whole, and this whole hints at connection, escape from solipsism's eclipse.

We think of the Italian *certo*, which is often used similarly to the word *sure*: as in 'sure-footed', or balanced upon what is here.  Settled, fixed.

Certainty pursues ardor before order, embracing the finite with such focus that it does not seek to systematize.  

Certainty as kindred to presence.  We have been taught that the Absolute is distant, that truer means farther.  Nothing could be further from the truth.

It has to do with closeness - pressing one's face into a view, standing so close to the static that we are certain the world is black or white.

The world is not grey, but granular, sifting black and white.  Uncertainty seeks a disembodied, broader view and then complains that it is blurry.

Being certain is not the same as being correct, which opponents gladly agree on. 

Each day we are becoming more and more precise, more and more certain, regarding our uncertainty. Faltering far from perfect knowledge, we are engraving a monument to our ignorance, etching ever more finely our limits, squinting to mark the finest filigreed detail. A temple to our inability to be gods.  A temple which, for all of its attention to the material, can never be inhabited by life.

If we... 

- believed that there were world enough for each of us
- could indulge all of our desires
- spread out our desires more broadly, fell in love with the leaf and sidewalk slush and dust among the corners
- did not attribute value to scarcity

...there would be no urge to lie.  And if Satan is the great deceiver, perhaps his lie is based on this fundamental fear: that God's goodness is not distributed equally everywhere and to everyone.

How can we allow our full weight to rest on this partial, albeit enamored, certainty?  The beauty and completeness of a corner.  The number of sacraments is without end.

We want to confer the weight of the absolute on what is near at hand.  Because we do not have the power for this, we can merely confer the weight of our whole will. To inhabit a thought or gaze with all of our self: to attend. 







To become certain, suffused with the thing which one gives oneself to, is to become camouflaged: the background of the story showing through so that one's self is hardly seen at all, except as a part of that scenery.
