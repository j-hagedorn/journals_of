### The Lukewarm, The Liars

There is a difference between not meaning what I say, and saying something contrary to what I mean.  Such an apparently small distinction in terms (*not meaning what I say vs. speaking contrary to what I mean*), such a vast gap in the result.  And the difference between these two states lies in a single element: certainty.  This single line contrasts the insincere with liars, the lukewarm against the cold-hearted.  In the first case one lacks certainty; in the second case one has certainty but does not share it.

The first are the inhabitants of Limbo, that "train of souls, so long..." which Dante encounters mulling about hell's gates, and which Eliot witnesses on the daily commute across London Bridge,^[see Dante's *Inferno 3.46*, Eliot's *Burial of the Dead l. 63*] a crowd large enough to include, on many days, me.

The second are the Liars, denizens of a more remote darkness: false counselors, politicians, betrayers, marketing executives.  Dante finds them approaching the center of the pit of Hell, and there at the center, where Satan chomps perpetually on one who used a kiss to mark a killing.

In Limbo our words dissolve in our mouths.  We explain our motives with studied myths, stories made routine, institutional, and tame: the Ragnarök [of Marvel Studios](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/) rather than the Ragnarök of the Völuspá's harrowed poet, starving amid a [volcanic winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k#Volcanic_eruptions).  In Limbo we talk about the dance's context, choreography, etc., yet we do not dance.^[The liar orchestrates the dance, but believes in the power which this orchestration gives him; not in the dance itself.]

We can hold up our stories like a beaded timeline, strung from one end to another.  We can mark the turns, climax, resolution; yet in order to do this we stand outside the story and it ceases to be ours.  It becomes a museum-piece: remarkable yet unbelievable.^[This is an aftermath of the death of tradition as the hands of history, the replacement of cyclical with linear time.  After all, if time is linear we can only look backward at our stories, and we are irrevocably cut off from them.  If time is circular, we tread and re-tread it.  If spiral, our story moves forward but with themes woven in and out.]


### Certainty and Humility

Surrounded by marketing and punditry, we might be forgiven for thinking that 'certainty' is synonymous with the use of words either for manipulation or weaponization.

We may be tempted to make the inverse mistake as well, but uncertainty is not the same as humility.  Humility concedes that one can only occupy one place and one focus at one time. One puts one's full weight into each step of the dance.  Humility entails that we acknowledge ourselves as partial, guttering out unless we join others.  The phrase "I'm partial to..." retains this flavor: of one's taste as tangible, peculiar and firmly held.  

To be certain is to embrace being partial.  And even that word, *partial*, holds the promise of a greater whole, and this whole hints at connection, escape from solipsism's eclipse.

It has to do with closeness - pressing one's face into a view, standing so close to the static that we are certain the world is black or white.

The world is not grey, but granular, sifting black and white.  Uncertainty seeks a disembodied, broader view and then complains that it is blurry.

Certainty pursues ardor before order: it is an embrace of finitude, but so focused on its object that it does not seek to systematize.

Each day we are becoming more and more precise, more and more certain, regarding our uncertainty. Faltering far from perfect knowledge, we are engraving a monument to our ignorance, etching ever more finely our limits, squinting to mark the finest filigreed detail. A temple to our inability to be gods.  A temple which, for all of its attention to the material, can never be inhabited by life.



Between the person who does not believe what they say and the person who lies: the first has a low view of the truth, A numbed sense of reality, wow the second it’s out of fear, the fear that there is not enough for both of us, and that I must disassemble in order to obtain power, vet power is more important than truth.

If we have believed that there was enough world for each of us, there would be no need for lying.

If we quenched our desires, there would be no need for lying. Or if we spread out our desires more broadly, fell in love with the leaf and sidewalk slush and dust in the corners.  There will be no need for lying if we did not attribute value to scarcity.

And if Satan is the great liar, perhaps his lie is based on this fundamental misconception: that God‘s goodness is not distributed equally everywhere and to everyone.

How can we allow our full weight to rest on this partial, albeit enamored, certainty?  The beauty and completeness of a corner.

Being certain is not the same as being correct, which each side of a debate will tell you (about their opponent). 

We want to confer the weight of the absolute on what is near at hand.  Because we do not have the power for this, we can merely confer the weight of our whole  will. To inhabit a thought or gaze with all of our self: to attend. 

Certainty as kindred to presence.

We think of the Italian *certo*, which is often used similarly to the word *sure*: as in 'sure-footed', or balanced upon what is here.

We have been taught that the Absolute is distant, that truer means farther.

To become certain, suffused with the thing which one gives oneself to, is to become camouflaged: the background of the story showing through so that one's self is hardly seen at all, except as a part of that scenery.
