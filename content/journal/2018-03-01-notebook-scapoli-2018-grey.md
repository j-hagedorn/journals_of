Home is a place of exploration

---

Christ.  At each new sight did he feel a corresponding corner lit within, a correspondence.

---

Of the laws governing the many bodies into a single body - which assumes an intelligence that transcends.

---

Maker of mud, from maths manifest  
with each years' season patterns overlaid awry  
wound about you as a wheel

---

If to be material = to be real, then the incarnation would not be a mercy but an evolution/birth.

Birth of the infinite into the finite; of the fractal & complex into the straight.

---

Up star axons  
Dark unreachable crown of horizons  

Why are we given space and time to learn presence?  

Learn presence by facing the mountain and not climbing it.

Standing face to face with another and not desiring their view.

Freefal into my own gravity.

---

Dante, Odysseus, all travellers are compelled by a vision of a rest somewhere else, 
their energy, frenetic,
shot outward toward X

If rest is not here, it must be there.

Thus all questing.  Thus hope for more.

Toward cities where someone has been present,
patiently laying stones.

---

"I WANT to be free from DESIRE" is hilarious, but pretty much reflects my spiritual state.

The desire for a good harvest.
The desire for a new iPhone.
The desire of olive leaves tugging their branches toward sunlight.

---

Against the pull of desire, conquest, nostalghia, the incarnation draws us to matter at hand, to presence.  

---

Only when I was dead  
did I realize I was not  
in a movie,  
or writing a poem.

---

"For us, wellbeing has reference to something other than ourselves."
- Aristotle, *Eudamion Ethics*

"He who is unable to live in society, or has no need... must either be a beast or a god." - Arist.

Nietszche's idea that "every specific body strives to become master over all space and to extend its force... and to thrust back all that resists its extension" des not actually describe the human organism: it describes a cancer.  The modern idea of the Individual Self is a cancer - it ends in entropy and loneliness.

---

Writing, sketching, etc. making is both a reaching out and gathering: a love of else and self.  

An enlarging of the world, swollen with reflection, with shared attention.

---

ICHOR

In Plato's Symposium (cf. Myth of Aristophanes), people need the "other half" (symbolon) to be complete.  He mean this both sexually and geometrically, but how many fractal edges do each of us have in our minds, bodies, days.

Freckle to freckle, scar to scar, sentence to finished sentence (a question)

The urge to explore the world is also the urge to contain it, in miniature, so that others by knowing me will have gained a world.

// The urge to know You is to contain You so that by knowing me you will know yourself.

Purgatorio 19.118-124

In *Inferno*, each punishment is a mirror of the sin.

In *Purgatorio* it is the same, but we encounter the real problem of how sin, rebounded, can break the mirror and lead beyond -

it is here that it is clear that sin is not the opposite of virtue but a twisting, so that when Justice holds the eyes of greed "Here on the Earth below", it is not an evil.

We must learn to look into the Earth, through sin and back to the source it twists.

---

I feel I am a dying species, looking out on a lost pocket of the world:

the radiating stone streets, the crumbling ornaments

it came to stay, it came to pass

---

Caserta Gardens

Even after my discussion with the kids about control of nature and centralized power, and with their hearts ardent for the poor, the children couldn't help but fall in love with Reggia Caserta.  It is a monument to what people can make: the miles-long garden promenade and fountains, the rooms gilded, large enough to hold our entire home.

Their eyes were filled with what was possible (E: "It would take my whole life."), because the place is so clearly made.

The older man's 'however' which I enjoin to this sense of wonder is secondary, a morality tale which can only be told after the construction of the thing.

Not a church, not a gesture outward of worship, but an inward-focused monument to control, to modulated power over people and materials.  SO stunning it is difficult to wrench one's eyes away toward the tenements, the city-crammed hills.

The angles radiate, rebound, as thoughts within a mind, each mind we encounter traipsing through cragged alleys

is such a palace, has made such a home,

each of us is a gardener, rooting out invasive species, tending the geometry we have made.

--- 

Yet walls are partial.  Spores blow in, ornamental moss.  Time whittles the starkest angles.

---

Isotherms.  All borders cradle, alienate.

---

If the motions of religion (cf. Harrison) are:

- gather good
- dispel bad

thankfulness is a curious motion.  Thankfulness is a response to the cosmos from the barest core of being.  Deeper than 'living' with its regulation of in/out, good/bad, etc.

Left and right hand of ICXC

"I must decrease, that he may increase" - John
"Let it be unto me" - Theotokos

---

On not seeing the relics of St. Bartholomew in Benevento

Just here, the bulge in the alley wall, graffiti and trash.

For all of POMO's juxtaposition of high/low, the cell continues to barricade virus

---

The holes in bread.  Like tissue, flesh, yet nothing!  Substantially insubstantial.  

Air bubbles crept into this rock so we could eat it!

---

Somewhere along the line I realize  
that I may be in heaven  
and never know  
since I never understood  
how to be anywhere.  

---

Trees: synapses shocked up

Birches: veins of bone

---

Needless to say that ideas fat-finger reality

but why do we seek, again and again, this correspondence

(beyond mere perception)

Patterns, coming and going.  Some distillation.

---

River water fastens molecules  
to flowering ice awhile

Change not a betrayal, but a trait, of form.

---

Recall: things exist beyond my reckoning,  
as the dark tree-stalk sifts up  
(through white noise, winter windshield),  
has roots stretching back into spring.  

As blind snow itself is made of springtime.  Of clear waters.  

---

Earliest religion/magic comes from the spear, from transcending distance.

Each time we threw the spear we wounded ourselves as well.

Opened up holes, distances that we can never, would never, untangle --  
taste of the sun in oily orangeskins

---

It is possible to reside in a house but not to live there.  

It is possible to be in heaven but not to know it.  

It is possible that heaven is a way of not being here. (a spear)


The thing came from afar, trailing strands, wiht one end still afar.

As each thing has a side in shadow.

Mystery compels us, which is to say that we both love and fear our blindness.  

---

Our partial-ness,  
our being bound to death.  

It is death that rests in each blindspot,  
our halfness,  
near as a half-remembered thought.  

There is no here that is not a there.  
We live in one another's beyond.  
Distances bound up in  
each cupped handful of water (read the report!)

The snow crossed with tracks.

There is no "Gospel of the Molecular Description of the Material Events of IC + XC"

Personhood is tangled up with truth.

"Science is personal" - M. Polanyi

---

Trentmunn ("Empire of Things") makes the case that the opening of supermarkets was felt as liberating b/c people did not have to feel judged by e.g. the local butcher, who knew them.  They could be anonymous - equating anonymity with freedom.  Certainly, butchers could have had more grace in these circumstances, but anonymity removes the imperative and the circumstances for us to practice grace/forgiveness.  We now live in a world (virtual at least), with pervasive anonymity, & we are less & less gracious.

---

The erosion of authority is an erosion of trust.

---

"creeds have become all but insignificant... not living expressions... but ancient barriers... the whole centre of gravity has in fact shifted from authority to experience." - Harrison, *Epilegomena...*

Creeds are barriers because they are brittle, contra experience.

Yet experience requires form, grows latticed upon the scaffolding of the world it encounters:  
a world of teachers, of stone paths, of brands and forms.
