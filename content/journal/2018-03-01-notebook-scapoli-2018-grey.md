Home is a place of exploration

---

Christ.  At each new sight did he feel a corresponding corner lit within, a correspondence.

---

Of the laws governing the many bodies into a single body - which assumes an intelligence that transcends.

---

Maker of mud, from maths manifest  
with each years' season patterns overlaid awry  
wound about you as a wheel

---

If to be material = to be real, then the incarnation would not be a mercy but an evolution/birth.

Birth of the infinite into the finite; of the fractal & complex into the straight.

---

Up star axons  
Dark unreachable crown of horizons  

Why are we given space and time to learn presence?  

Learn presence by facing the mountain and not climbing it.

Standing face to face with another and not desiring their view.

Freefal into my own gravity.

---

Dante, Odysseus, all travellers are compelled by a vision of a rest somewhere else, 
their energy, frenetic,
shot outward toward X

If rest is not here, it must be there.

Thus all questing.  Thus hope for more.

Toward cities where someone has been present,
patiently laying stones.

---

"I WANT to be free from DESIRE" is hilarious, but pretty much reflects my spiritual state.

The desire for a good harvest.
The desire for a new iPhone.
The desire of olive leaves tugging their branches toward sunlight.

---

Against the pull of desire, conquest, nostalghia, the incarnation draws us to matter at hand, to presence.  

---

Only when I was dead  
did I realize I was not  
in a movie,  
or writing a poem.

---

"For us, wellbeing has reference to something other than ourselves."
- Aristotle, *Eudamion Ethics*

"He who is unable to live in society, or has no need... must either be a beast or a god." - Arist.

Nietszche's idea that "every specific body strives to become master over all space and to extend its force... and to thrust back all that resists its extension" does not actually describe the human organism: it describes a cancer.  The modern idea of the Individual Self is a cancer - it ends in entropy and loneliness.

---

Writing, sketching, etc. making is both a reaching out and gathering: a love of else and self.  

An enlarging of the world, swollen with reflection, with shared attention.

---

ICHOR

In Plato's Symposium (cf. Myth of Aristophanes), people need the "other half" (symbolon) to be complete.  He mean this both sexually and geometrically, but how many fractal edges do each of us have in our minds, bodies, days.

Freckle to freckle, scar to scar, sentence to finished sentence (a question)

The urge to explore the world is also the urge to contain it, in miniature, so that others by knowing me will have gained a world.

// The urge to know You is to contain You so that by knowing me you will know yourself.

---

Purgatorio 19.118-124

In *Inferno*, each punishment is a mirror of the sin.

In *Purgatorio* it is the same, but we encounter the real problem of how sin, rebounded, can break the mirror and lead beyond -

it is here that it is clear that sin is not the opposite of virtue but a twisting, so that when Justice holds the eyes of greed "Here on the Earth below", it is not an evil.

We must learn to look into the Earth, through sin and back to the source it twists.

---

I feel I am a dying species, looking out on a lost pocket of the world:

the radiating stone streets, the crumbling ornaments

it came to stay, it came to pass

---

Caserta Gardens

Even after my discussion with the kids about control of nature and centralized power, and with their hearts ardent for the poor, the children couldn't help but fall in love with Reggia Caserta.  It is a monument to what people can make: the miles-long garden promenade and fountains, the rooms gilded, large enough to hold our entire home.

Their eyes were filled with what was possible (E: "It would take my whole life."), because the place is so clearly made.

The older man's 'however' which I enjoin to this sense of wonder is secondary, a morality tale which can only be told after the construction of the thing.

Not a church, not a gesture outward of worship, but an inward-focused monument to control, to modulated power over people and materials.  SO stunning it is difficult to wrench one's eyes away toward the tenements, the city-crammed hills.

The angles radiate, rebound, as thoughts within a mind, each mind we encounter traipsing through cragged alleys

is such a palace, has made such a home,

each of us is a gardener, rooting out invasive species, tending the geometry we have made.

--- 

Yet walls are partial.  Spores blow in, ornamental moss.  Time whittles the starkest angles.

---

Isotherms.  All borders cradle, alienate.

---

If the motions of religion (cf. Harrison) are:

- gather good
- dispel bad

thankfulness is a curious motion.  Thankfulness is a response to the cosmos from the barest core of being.  Deeper than 'living' with its regulation of in/out, good/bad, etc.

---

Left and right hand of ICXC

"I must decrease, that he may increase" - John
"Let it be unto me" - Theotokos

---

On not seeing the relics of St. Bartholomew in Benevento

Just here, the bulge in the alley wall, graffiti and trash.

For all of POMO's juxtaposition of high/low, the cell continues to barricade virus

---

The holes in bread.  Like tissue, flesh, yet nothing!  Substantially insubstantial.  

Air bubbles crept into this rock so we could eat it!

---

Somewhere along the line I realize  
that I may be in heaven  
and never know  
since I never understood  
how to be anywhere.  

---

Trees: synapses shocked up

Birches: veins of bone

---

Needless to say that ideas fat-finger reality

but why do we seek, again and again, this correspondence

(beyond mere perception)

Patterns, coming and going.  Some distillation.

---

River water fastens molecules  
to flowering ice awhile

Change not a betrayal, but a trait, of form.

---

Recall: things exist beyond my reckoning,  
as the dark tree-stalk sifts up  
(through white noise, winter windshield),  
has roots stretching back into spring.  

As blind snow itself is made of springtime.  Of clear waters.  

---

Earliest religion/magic comes from the spear, from transcending distance.

Each time we threw the spear we wounded ourselves as well.

Opened up holes, distances that we can never, would never, untangle --  
taste of the sun in oily orangeskins

---

It is possible to reside in a house but not to live there.  

It is possible to be in heaven but not to know it.  

It is possible that heaven is a way of not being here. (a spear)


The thing came from afar, trailing strands, wiht one end still afar.

As each thing has a side in shadow.

Mystery compels us, which is to say that we both love and fear our blindness.  

---

Our partial-ness,  
our being bound to death.  

It is death that rests in each blindspot,  
our halfness,  
near as a half-remembered thought.  

There is no here that is not a there.  
We live in one another's beyond.  
Distances bound up in  
each cupped handful of water (read the report!)

The snow crossed with tracks.

---

There is no "Gospel of the Molecular Description of the Material Events of IC + XC"

Personhood is tangled up with truth.

"Science is personal" - M. Polanyi

---

Trentmunn ("Empire of Things") makes the case that the opening of supermarkets was felt as liberating b/c people did not have to feel judged by e.g. the local butcher, who knew them.  They could be anonymous - equating anonymity with freedom.  Certainly, butchers could have had more grace in these circumstances, but anonymity removes the imperative and the circumstances for us to practice grace/forgiveness.  We now live in a world (virtual at least), with pervasive anonymity, & we are less & less gracious.

---

The erosion of authority is an erosion of trust.

---

"creeds have become all but insignificant... not living expressions... but ancient barriers... the whole centre of gravity has in fact shifted from authority to experience." - Harrison, *Epilegomena...*

Creeds are barriers because they are brittle, contra experience.

Yet experience requires form, grows latticed upon the scaffolding of the world it encounters:  
a world of teachers, of stone paths, of brands and forms.

---

Winter piazza, yellow and shadow.

Silver olive petals gusting up.

The air is thick with distances and thus no longer distant.

How, in Zeno's paradox, one can never get anywhere but closer.

---

A leaf falls  
through leaves  

rasping
once, again, once

(footfalls on the branches)

There is no away but toward.

No greeting other than the unwound tail of a departure.
No novelties but hand-me-downs.

Blown into vistas by the tradewinds.

---

Being solitary is a kind of death-within-life, a prefiguring of death.  Silence, which is a necessity for living with others to occur ("Unless it die...")

In-breath and out-breath.

But there is no true being alone.  Absolute zero alone.

I am accompanied by light and the trees' silver praise and the dense dark -- loneliness is an illusion, like the many which surround me.

There is only the commerce with people and stones and air and other beings.  I am one.

---
[Castelnuovo]

Humorous world

Long stalk bent by an invisible finger
and sprung back --  
metronome.

Silly I think the world needs hands and an idea of time
to lave the shade-shaped  
frost on the far sides of rocks.

---

Since it takes 8 minutes for sunlight to reach us,
the sun has already risen over the wall of hills
when I first glimpse it.

It threw itself toward me even before I arrived.

---

windy carapace  
green felt melody  

verted  

slanted plains
shafts and spines

shattered horizons, mid revolution

verdure   ruck    fold
mist-tangled

brittle spindle

folded shadow crumpled

---

Many of the protective walls of Pompeii  
are made of volcanic rocks.

---

"The heavenly wielder of the keys,  
who throws open the gates of heaven."

St. Peter (cf. Aldhelm, *Carmina Ecclesiastica*)
//  
Janus (cf. Ovid, *Fasti*)

2 keys, 2 faces, 2 directions

---

In Rome, I encounter IC+XC made tangible 
- in the bones of hands that touched him, in the steps he walked up -  
but always through the institution of the Church (its buildings, janitors, scholars, etc.)

Of course we only know history, what has happened, through the institutions which were a result of that 'happening'.

Institutions/traditions abide and carry through time

but how is, and is, it possible to sift back through the accreted stories to the Divine Word?

---

MONUMENT--and edifice large and clear enough that time's storm of static cannot erode it.

OR

CITY--with corners where people live, that people maintain, prone to local variations but alive

---

St. Thomas is so often equated with the skeptic, the scientist... why not the lover?

---

this rift, between the CITY & the MOUNTAINTOP has always been impassable for me.

---

Not the voice saying "Come and find my meaning", but "Come and play with me in the fields of meaning"

*They fraudulently protected themselves for the sake of enjoying the light of this brief life*
- Augustine, Civ. Dei Ch. 1

*He who has no tomb has the sky for a vault.*
- Lucan, Pharsalia vii. 819

*The body is... a apart of man's very nature.*  - Augustine, CD, ch. 13

*So material a difference does it make, not what ills are suffered, but what kind of man suffers them.  For, stirred up with the same movement, mud exhales a horrible stench & ointment emits a fragrant odor.* - Aug, CD, Ch. 8

*The poor-spirited fear which prompts us to choose rather to live long in fear of so many deaths, than to die once...* - Aug, CD, Ch. 11

---

With a focus on (and metrics for) "Views", "Return visits", etc., marketers and start-ups understand the primacy of a resource which I too often throw away: *ATTENTION*

I give attention to junk mail, to gossip, to memes -- that is to say, I let those things steal my attention, rather than purposefully using it.

The power of attention is that it lays one stone on another: makes homes, cultures, cities.

Attention is to direct the energy of one's intelligence (always entwined with ones Love) on the world outside of oneself.

When I attend to the natural world in this way, it rewards me with beauty, breath, life--slow growth.

We are nourished by reality because it is substantial.  When we attend to ourselves by feeding our split-second hungers, or propping up our superficial advert identities, we come away hungry--but we keep going back because that's what we're fed.

---

For all the accomplishments, predictions,
inventions of science - by itself,
it still leaves the world hollow if. “we murder to dissect”

The fact becomes amputated 
from the living reality

This is // to the medieval view 
of sin, as a veil which keeps
us from reality

---

Peregrination
    {our home is afar
&
    {our hope is @ our feet

    How I hold to your body 
    Like a raft, a coffin sized ARK.

---

Now there is nothing but away

Each moment dissipates
As soon as breath inflates the lungs,
As color flourishes (fractures in) the eye,
It inhabits that desiccated world of distance & desire

Of flowers locked in birds or books
In hope or memory
………………
 no… a presence that overflows the present,
That spills into past & future

---

cf . Agirrezabal, “ Machine learning for metrical analysis” where the author states that,
In poetry, precision of meaning/denotation is often ‘sacrificed’ for sonic, rhythmic considerations.


All words have an apophatic distance from what they refer to
    Thus complete accuracy is impossible
        & in fact the more accurate a language is (e.g. in engineering specs.) 
        The less ‘meaningful’ people find it. 

---
In writing anything that has meaning (ie. that resounds within the person), 
precision cannot be the sole consideration.

Precision is akin to justice, ‘lex talionis’ (weighing each work in the balance) --
Yet words are inadequate to capture the actual world (‘chair’, ‘leaves’, etc),
As they are to capture theological truths (‘God”, etc.)

So, for any understanding, for any dialogue, there must be trust, grace
    And for us to extend grace we must feel safe, feel seen

---

At the basis of all communication,
All poetry,
Is love, the union of persons.

(thus no pattern recognition or machine-generated stanzas will ever be sufficient)



If recognition was only possible when we were recognized, diminishing returns would lead us all to be isolated. 

---

In order for me to listen
        (to enter communion) 
I must feel that
    You see me
    We are going somewhere

Communication (requires) → trust→ recognition→ …
    (what supports /nourishes our ability to recognize , to see another person…)
    Either mutual recognition → recognition
    Or some external source → greater love, ie. God, or reservoir from others. 

---

Compare, for example, two scenarios:
Conversaion @ortofrutta in italian where I don’t speak the language
Thread regarding political beliefs on FB.

In both cases it is not possible for an exhaustive/exact communication because I lack adequate language, or use a different language (in a different sense in A or B)

However, recipients of my feeble communication can choose to fill in the gaps of my meaning with trust or with suspicion. 


---


Tonight again I sit with my feet on the table 
Carving off the hard scallop of the soles,
Tasting of travel & want

________________________

The taste at the boundary 
Of the small-starred penumbra
My perception 
Is blood, is iron & warm river
My blood, & now yours
You who reach your hand under
My sky & beckon

---

These clouds

    The Meditteranean hoisting 
    Itself up
    Wave by wave
    In mist to travel 
    Across the mountains

---

Overheard:
“Everything is going to change the world”

_______________________

The way light plays in the eye
It is hard to see:
Is the valley folding 
Or unfolding?

---

Carving lungfulls of air
Out of the soft stone
A hammer at a time
(how much effort it is to chisel out space for a single breath)

Whose names are writ on shifting sounds 
Systems of air. 

---
For days made of decades 
Seconds stitches w/ centuries
Men have been piling up stones 
Into houses, spires

Rubbing objects against other objects,
Making marks

Their mastery is lost & their mistakes are lost
In an obscure avg. (shuffling dust)

Pressing with fingers, with shells &
The jaws of beasts - 
Afternoons spent pressing intricate
Patterns into clay.

---

Protective glass crazing,
Eroding slowly around
The ancient urns

Should one grudge the painter his
    Attention to each stroke
    Describing the garments curves
    & bunches, the details
    Which would disappear quick
    As the model stood? 
Grudge me these lines 
And if we say we draw an 
Idea (which is a  pattern matter follows), 
Is it any less evanescent? 

---

Carved stones out of the
Space of their own hunger
Out of a desire to exist

_________

?{ take names of famous 
    People & rearrange to 
    Make a poem about 
    Inaccessible  -- death}

---


Holding objects to the light
    Such as themselves…
___

We make straight lines 
Because what is round reminds 
Us we erode, prefigures death
___

To plant some thought
Some fragrant fragment
In your memory
    (remember me)
But if it tastes of me, it will
Not be true, will pull you back gravid earthward
        To stone

---

As if they took 
A chisel to write
Kept carving until
A cavern into a cathedral
___

We see death around us
& we want to bury
Ourselves in others 
Before they bury us 
In dirt.

---

It pours & pours
There is no time to lose
    Only to bathe in

---

If birds have wings there has to be
 another place
If birds have wings the has to be 
    Somewhere else
If birds fly the air holds us
    & us
Please please please

They dreamed of people

Sprouting wings pouring from their pores
& Then of angels 
Then of heaven

---

to rewind a drop of rain
perfectly
to reduce oneself into

its shuddering journey back
into the cloud

"A man cannot go back into his mothers womb" - Nicodemus

---

How you would cup the mind
in your hands

If one could rewind just one raindrop
reduce me perfectly into
a shuddering journey back
to mist

---

There are estimates for how much space would be needed to fit all of humanity, shoulder to shoulder.

I may have found the perfect place, in Basilicata's rainswept plains.
Between the wind turbines, the mouldering villas.
We could just lie down there, let the Spring taste our toil.

---

Sheep, with their blonde, scummy shocks of wool.  Like hairshirts.
