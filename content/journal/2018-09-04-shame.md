In Dante's *Purgatory*, in the same passage where he denounces the practice of Florentine women going around with their nipples bared, I was struck unexpectedly by the use of the word *shame*: 

*...but shameless as they are, if they really*  
*knew what swift heaven is preparing...* [23.106-8, trans. Merwin]  

I don't find this passage particularly lovely or noteworthy, BTW, except that it frames shame with a positive connotation which we have almost entirely lost in common speech. We have a vestigial notion of shame as a positive force in our use of the word *shameless*, as in: "He's a shameless self-promoter."  But to say that a person was "without shame", as though this were a lack as serious as a missing organ, seems entirely foreign to us. 

Good riddance, perhaps, to this toxin.  Yet I want to pause a moment before hoisting out this anachronism, since the motion of shame is an echo of some tones I most value from the medeival world: most notably its unceremonious decentering of the individual point of view.  The belief that truth is larger than me and requires no sanctions from me. The notion of shame drifts in this eccentric orbit, out in the suburbs of meaning, since one has shame by being out of touch, reft from a center gravity impels us toward.  And the vertigo associated with this gravity, perhaps, is shame.^[Which would mean that shame is occasioned by the presence / perception of the Divine, as in the garden of Eden and lips of Isaiah.]

Shame, as it is defined in modern psychological literature, may be different in meaning then but Dante intended.  Nevertheless, it seems worth distinguishing from guilt. Guilt is a response to an individual or at least define a bowl set of actions or circumstances, while shame is generalized: an existential posture of the soul itself.  “You are bad“ as opposed to “that was bad”.

(Look at research that Mike shared from psychology studies regarding the lifelong impact of shame)

Thinking about how I have raised my children, how I spoke to them even this morning, it seems a task requiring almost super human dexterity to teach children Without also instilling in them some sense of not being enough. For shame, linked as it is to our estrangement from The empyrean, Is also closely linked and perhaps impossible to sever from its sibling, hope. And hope is at the center of all inquiry and effort. Imagination/intuition, and hope to make it incarnate. The plans for the heavenly city and the bricks.

And hope, it’s self is coupled all set with desire, ingratitude and other postures of the soul which are directed away from the present. Shame, hope, desire: We kindred be.

Shame and hope, then, seem to be the two sides of the same magnet. With Sheehan repelling and hope pulling in. Shame isolates and hope solicits.  And this is why I have had such an aversion to even talking about shame for so much of my adult life: that I since it is at the base of the isolation which I so persistently feel.  That we have spoken, I have often been extrapolating from a much more thorough knowledge of shame.

Is Hope, then, the smile or apology which keeps us coming back to our abuser?  Hope can certainly be missed placed, and even harmful: one things of Jones town or of the heavens gate calls which led to their followers to death promised on false hope. If our aim is to be congruent, ally and with reality, Then hope and other happier dispositions do not escape our scrutiny near the because they lied to us with indoor things while lying to us: anesthesia is not neutral in the search for truth.

In the story of Pandora, hope is the small fulcrum which provides leverage against evil and suffering.  Hope is the cosmological constant inserted in the equation for no logical reason except that the universe is senseless without it.

Unless, of course, one dispensed entirely with memory and of us with a lingering pain in the ass with the need for justice and balance that persists not just in one perfect counterpoised moment, but across all time.
