*Begun on train to Firenze, April 2018*
*Done on bus to FCO, May 2018*

*Continued from end of grey notebook*

on revision...

Thoughts are most often imprecise things, with multiple connections, strong cables 
lapsing into patches of fog... and so are words

like Proteus, whose colors/appearances stall when you grab him, except that you then 
realize that you have only his skin, a skein of an idea...

Delight is in the slippery spaces between words, confusion also

The fact that I can look back on my own notes from years past and not be able to reassemble 
what I was trying to say, what I 'intended'--this seems to imply that I do not *have* ideas 
in the way that I have other things (or perhaps I do, and all having is illusory) & certainly 
implies that words are not a solid currency for ideas.

If I do pick up notes from years past, I am unlikely to develop them in the same manner.

Thoughts are a kind of multimedia hybrid--of observations, leaves tacked to paper, tastes and 
of abstractions, developed from top-to-bottom (which is to say, by stating a general, non-detailed 
phrase and successively filling in the details, circling around foggy patches of the initial articulation)

The other thing about thought which belies any masquerade of 'omniscience' or 'infallibility'... 
my ideas tend to be born somewhat arbitrarily
