*Begun on train to Firenze, April 2018*
*Done on bus to FCO, May 2018*

*Continued from end of grey notebook*

on revision...

Thoughts are most often imprecise things, with multiple connections, strong cables 
lapsing into patches of fog... and so are words

like Proteus, whose colors/appearances stall when you grab him, except that you then 
realize that you have only his skin, a skein of an idea...

Delight is in the slippery spaces between words, confusion also

The fact that I can look back on my own notes from years past and not be able to reassemble 
what I was trying to say, what I 'intended'--this seems to imply that I do not *have* ideas 
in the way that I have other things (or perhaps I do, and all having is illusory) & certainly 
implies that words are not a solid currency for ideas.

If I do pick up notes from years past, I am unlikely to develop them in the same manner.

Thoughts are a kind of multimedia hybrid--of observations, leaves tacked to paper, tastes and 
of abstractions, developed from top-to-bottom (which is to say, by stating a general, non-detailed 
phrase and successively filling in the details, circling around foggy patches of the initial articulation)

The other thing about thought which belies any masquerade of 'omniscience' or 'infallibility'... 
my ideas tend to be born somewhat arbitrarily, borne by unforeseen confluences & unforced associations 
regarding those confluences.

I put my stake in the earth wherever this happens to occur (lightning stone), and it ends up serving as a 
cornerstone, though there is nothing about the starting place which 'deserves' primacy.

If we do not keep our words and ideas open to growth and interaction when we communicate, we risk always 
being at war. (fight vs. flight, unicursal labyrinth vs. city streets)

There is no space for friendship then, only for being either misunderstood or obeyed.  And however we may 
console ourselves that we are 'geniuses' or 'leaders', we will be alone, 

which is contrary to the nature of persons, or who we are.

Back to the term 'communication', to be brought together, and that less debased form of the concept, where 
the idea of union still supercedes mere 'transmission'-- COMMUNION

where the sender steps down into the medium of the receiver, into the receiver's own self, beyond 
what is possible.

In doctrine, in approaches and entrances to the same holy ground, there is always dance, deja-vu, the 
quality of change-without-change, which is the definition of SYMMETRY

Thinking specifically of Christian doctrine, it is the ORGANISM which speaks/chants/etc. which is constant: 
the BODY of IC+XC stretched across time and space,

while the formulae change: there is not a 'magic combination' of words.

Orsanmichele

A church (b. 832) used as a granary, which was converted back to a church when an icon of the Virgin 
had mircles attributed to it.

You can still see ducts & shafts coming down from the granary (relocated to the second floor) into the nave through 
the pillars.  Guilds gathered outside, along the sides of the building--but the center of that commerce was still a 
chamber oriented inward toward to the sacred--to something beyond control, un-ownable.

They could not occupy that center.

Now no one believes in miracles anymre, but they still come into that center to sit, for silence and beauty.

Art is a way of seeing which ennobles, which magnifies the portions of the world it passes over.

The artist is nothing, a name attached to a way of seeing--but that sight is an entire world.

[We use their names now to refer to those worlds]

& it invites others to enter, & to be with, see with, in a union, a love.

"I swim against the tide"

[Arnaut Daniel, *Canso*, re: desire for a woman]

Is all desire a swimming against the tide?

The tide, glittering mesh of launch and gravity
threshold of want and limit
