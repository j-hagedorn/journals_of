*Begun on train to Firenze, April 2018*
*Done on bus to FCO, May 2018*

*Continued from end of grey notebook*

on revision...

Thoughts are most often imprecise things, with multiple connections, strong cables 
lapsing into patches of fog... and so are words

like Proteus, whose colors/appearances stall when you grab him, except that you then 
realize that you have only his skin, a skein of an idea...

Delight is in the slippery spaces between words, confusion also

---

The fact that I can look back on my own notes from years past and not be able to reassemble 
what I was trying to say, what I 'intended'--this seems to imply that I do not *have* ideas 
in the way that I have other things (or perhaps I do, and all having is illusory) & certainly 
implies that words are not a solid currency for ideas.

If I do pick up notes from years past, I am unlikely to develop them in the same manner.

Thoughts are a kind of multimedia hybrid--of observations, leaves tacked to paper, tastes and 
of abstractions, developed from top-to-bottom (which is to say, by stating a general, non-detailed 
phrase and successively filling in the details, circling around foggy patches of the initial articulation)

The other thing about thought which belies any masquerade of 'omniscience' or 'infallibility'... 
my ideas tend to be born somewhat arbitrarily, borne by unforeseen confluences & unforced associations 
regarding those confluences.

I put my stake in the earth wherever this happens to occur (lightning stone), and it ends up serving as a 
cornerstone, though there is nothing about the starting place which 'deserves' primacy.

If we do not keep our words and ideas open to growth and interaction when we communicate, we risk always 
being at war. (fight vs. flight, unicursal labyrinth vs. city streets)

There is no space for friendship then, only for being either misunderstood or obeyed.  And however we may 
console ourselves that we are 'geniuses' or 'leaders', we will be alone, 

which is contrary to the nature of persons, or who we are.

Back to the term 'communication', to be brought together, and that less debased form of the concept, where 
the idea of union still supercedes mere 'transmission'-- COMMUNION

where the sender steps down into the medium of the receiver, into the receiver's own self, beyond 
what is possible.

In doctrine, in approaches and entrances to the same holy ground, there is always dance, deja-vu, the 
quality of change-without-change, which is the definition of SYMMETRY

Thinking specifically of Christian doctrine, it is the ORGANISM which speaks/chants/etc. which is constant: 
the BODY of IC+XC stretched across time and space,

while the formulae change: there is not a 'magic combination' of words.

Orsanmichele

A church (b. 832) used as a granary, which was converted back to a church when an icon of the Virgin 
had mircles attributed to it.

You can still see ducts & shafts coming down from the granary (relocated to the second floor) into the nave through 
the pillars.  Guilds gathered outside, along the sides of the building--but the center of that commerce was still a 
chamber oriented inward toward to the sacred--to something beyond control, un-ownable.

They could not occupy that center.

Now no one believes in miracles anymore, but they still come into that center to sit, for silence and beauty.

Art is a way of seeing which ennobles, which magnifies the portions of the world it passes over.

The artist is nothing, a name attached to a way of seeing--but that sight is an entire world.

[We use their names now to refer to those worlds]

& it invites others to enter, & to be with, see with, in a union, a love.

"e le sue voci / con *sitiunt*"

[the Angel] "confined his words to *THIRST*" [Purg. 22.6.]

"I swim against the tide"

[Arnaut Daniel, *Canso*, re: desire for a woman]

Is all desire a swimming against the tide?

The tide, glittering mesh of launch and gravity
threshold of want and limit

---

A skeptic could argue (especially in a milieu bombarded by ads & vitriol) 
that ideas, and therefore art, are a form of mind control--an attempt to 
colonize and control others' way of seeing.  This seems almost hopelessly 
(literally) silly.

An idea, in order to be worthwhile, must be strong--yet its strength is like that of a cell wall, permeable.  It lets in nutrients and keeps out what is harmful.

[In this sense, both cells and ideas resemble rituals, as described by Jane Ellen Harrison, whose primary function is regulatory: 'in with the good, out with the bad']

An idea, a work of art, must also co-exist with other voices,

["Let there be commerce between us": Pound to Whitman]

And not harm, but borrow and savor, and give to others.  Be food for others.

["Enlarge the available stock of metaphors" - Coleridge; and forms, colors, figures...]

& the miracle/mystery is that meaning can catch aflame and not be consumed, like the burning bush where the Logos appeared.

[Artists forget this, jockeying for influence: as Brunelleschi dissing Donatello's wooden 'Crussifissione']

And all wrought things attending to and partaking of the rhythm of what is, the pinnacles and hallows, glow with this light.

We will not find peace in another age if we have not made it here.

We will not see beauty in another world, if we have not tuned our sight here, composed our breath.

Above our heads the vaulted arches, crisscrossed, which say:

"You are forever entering" and "You are here"

// between Buddhism and Christianity, which diagnose our condition as desire, yet Buddhism 
sees desire as illusory, while XC sees it as the germ of something vaster.

Bargello--
Sculptures are lonely, disconnected, each balanced on its own axis, 
arc of torso radiating to a solitary base.

Each separate equipoise, however frenzied, ends in itself--and can never be perfect, 
since to be perfect is to be beyond the limits of oneself.

---

Beatrice's tomb is small, easily unnoticed.  Yet all of the Divina Commedia is an attempt 
to bore through this stone.  Even now, as Dante lies long in Ravenna, the poem continues to 
scratch at this sepulchre,

and will continue, as long as language is, for in the urge to speak is the urge to conquer death.

Death, which is isolation.

Heaven is embedded in the act of speech.  Even the animals who have symbolic speech have this.

The there.  Thereafter.  Only ever arrived at through here.

---

It is hard to grow a halo.  In Perugino's *Pieta*, Mary Magdalene holds the feet of Christ, 
his toenails presumably still growing, metatarsals splintered under room-temperature skin, 

Tears congeal on her face, as beautiful as that of any woman standing in this gallery.

And it appears above her head like an incipient thought, and if she tried to hold onto it, 
it would disappear.

---

Inasmuch as Dante's pursuit of Beatrice ranged beyond what is seen, it was perhaps most of all 
a spectacular failure to find Heaven in the midst of his own life.  

"In the midst of my life I found myself..."

It can be harder to reach out across the kitchen, across the tense bed, 
than across the gulf of death, to build the terrestrial paradise.

Not the journey away, up the mountains, but the walk home.  Where words are not needed,
because there is nowhere to gesture to. An arm in an arm, the interlocking orbits.

---

For the spiral to spin, it needs 2 centers, inclined around each other.
We circle each other while setting the table.

It is as though he had forgotten, against all evidence at the tip of his pen, that words have 
the power not only to point but to gather in.

I like to think that when he saw Gemma and the kids again, he brought it all back.
That he made love to her like a man who has startle up from drowning.
That he did dishes and laundry sometimes, and gardened with a pocketful of the pollen which grows the world.

I do not think he did.

---

You drown me in the river again 
and again, we are both 
drowning, by turns saving, by 
turns being saved

Who knows where the river is bringing our bodies,
tumbled by watery light & depth, except 
that we are each others

When we make love I am a drowning man, gasping for your breath.

---

In a fresco of us, each has one hand rising outward from the wall,
painting the other
gathering pigments from the air,
dandelion wisps, and pollen for the eyedeep gleam.

---

In the afterworld, your soft hands are my scales.
In the meantime, you must be the bird who flies 
with my heart strung to your ankle.

---

Heaven is painted with the lines and tinctures of earth, and

earth is a painting of heaven.

---

Despite the posthumous application of 'Divina' to *La Commedia*, it sems apt enough.

Unlike 'sacra', 'divina' has the connotation of discovery, of coming to knowledge, of motion.

---

Cimabue's *Crussifissione* (and its adoption as the primary figure of Deity in the West, the *Christus patiens*) 
pulls toward the weight of earth, away from the Byzantine world and its *un*earthly gravity. Cf. Francis Bacon, "I always saw a worm crawling down a cross".

With the focus on 'humanity', on bringing down the heavenly, we were grasping it as a rope to escape, 
and were left holding the slack and clammy corpse of a god

And, as if at the bottom of this crucifix, sit all of the sculptures of the Renaissance, trapped in their separate weights.  

(Recall that Perseus used Medusa's head to turn monsters into stone.  Inasmuch as we are individual, that is to say asocial, we are monsters.  And turned to monuments.)

What does one do with a dead god but feel guilt?  And so we usher in an age of guilt, where I am the center but never enough.

In a well with a fallen rope.

"those old pagan gods still going to and fro on the earth, under all sorts of disguises"
