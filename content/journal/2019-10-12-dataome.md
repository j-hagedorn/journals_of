Maybe my interest derives from a life saturated by the Christian notion of the *Word made flesh*.  Maybe it comes from a desire to reconcile my fascination with symbols and simultaneously with the ungovernable sea of stuff surrounding me.  Perhaps from other strands whose weaving-needles clack at the base of my cerebellum.  I'm not sure.  But I've always been drawn to ways of thinking about words which inhabit an uneasy space between symbolic and raw material.

The notion of the word as virus in Burroughs,^[see Burroughs, W.S. [Electronic Revolution](http://www.ubu.com/historical/burroughs/electronic_revolution.pdf), 1970.] compelled me when I first read it, as have the various myths in which words manifest themselves upon plants, and more recently the work in the field of biosemiotics: all of these strike a chord in me which I simultaneously savor and fear is ridiculous.

In the paragraphs which follow, I won't be advancing any new theory, at least not deliberately: just hacking a path through some abstract ideas and hopefully getting clarity on how to live under their canopy. 

### Contexts of Knowledge: Internal and External

There are various ways of conceptualizing the 'stuff' of symbolized human thought, but I can start with a simple distinction: whether it is inside or outside of me.  

- **External:** What is housed outside of my body, but close-at-hand. Information as a *garden*, a *placenta*, a *library*.
- **Internal:** What has been ingested by me and materially changed me.  Information as *medicine*, a *virus*, *food*.

These are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they exist alongside each other every day.  I take information from the internet, think about it (*internal*), and write something on the internet in response (*external*). This is also not a distinction between 'good' or 'bad'; a medicine (*pharmakon*) can be both healing agent and poison, and both possibilities are alive in it at any moment.  Words are pulsing with this power: we access it, take it into ourselves, and generate more. 

### External: The Placental Garden Library

And what we collectively generate remains with us.  References to created artifacts having their own life, independent of the biological existence of their makers, have been around for a long time. Recall Horace’s "Life is short, art is long."  But contrasting art with life doesn't do justice to their inter-penetration: the ways in which art insinuates itself into life, which in turn pollinates other art, and so on.  Shakespeare’s sonnet 18 gets closer to articulating this symbiosis, with its closing promise that "so long lives this, and this gives life to thee."  Anything that *lives*, whether literally or figuratively, requires organization and maintenance, requires energy.

A recent essay on "*the selfish Dataome*" by astrophysicist Caleb Scharf^[See Scharf, C. [The Selfish Dataome](http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/the-selfish-dataome). *Nautilus*, Issue 065: In Plain Sight.] argues that the human race might usefully be conceived of as a supporting organelle for its own *dataome*: a portmanteau he defines as "the data outside of our biological selves."  Human knowledge exists like a placenta alongside the generations and civilizations: feeding us, entangled with us, yet somehow separate.

According to Scharf, this dataome encompasses all human representation of thoughts, and thus goes all the way back to handprints on cavern walls and myths in the oral tradition. It also broadens the notion of 'word' to include any artifact which represents a thought: that is, any data which is the representational exhaust of human perception and thought.  The cave paintings at Lascaux.  Photos of cat antics.  Wisdom literature.  The news.  The fake news.

This cloud of symbols and information is not precisely human, but floats alongside humanity like a placenta: a source of nourishment digesting the broader world and reconstituting it for us.  And just as the placenta was not invented or consciously constructed by humans, the act of patterning and representation exemplified by the *dataome* was not invented by us either.^[This is, I believe, contrary to Scharf's conception of the *dataome*, but borne out by considerations of symbolic activity that are less anthropocentric.  According to Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and other logocentric conceptions of reality, meaning is also 'unmade by hands': discovered not invented.  These conceptions are not solely held by religions, either.  See, for instance: Barbieri, Marcello. (2012). Codepoiesis – the Deep Logic of Life. Biosemiotics. 5. 10.1007/s12304-012-9162-4.  Or Umberto Eco's lovely reminiscence of a colleague in: Eco, Umberto. (2018). Giorgio Prodi and the lower threshold of semiotics. Sign Systems Studies. 46. 343. 10.12697/SSS.2018.46.2-3.07.]

Alongside these natural organisms, we humans, so adept at mimicry, create smaller external repositories.  Our derivative works are simpler, less facetted, with a practical beauty: the library, the garden.  Just as a library collects many books and organizes them, the garden collects many plants that may not naturally occur together.  I walk out to my garden to get some basil leaves; I go to the library to get books on systemic racism in America.

We can lay out the relation between these external sources of nourishment in the form of analogies.  In each pair below, the first is natural and the second is a human-curated invention which mirrors it (i.e. *natural* : *mirror*)

*forest* : *garden* :: *placenta* : *meal* :: *dataome* : *library*

These are objects that we can point to, and they are also redolent with myth.  There are echoes of these images among various world-founding myths which frame creation as a separation of chaos from cosmos, such as the story of the Garden of Eden.  In this account the first habitation of humans is not made by them but fashioned with love and care by Another: an Ur-garden, similar to a placenta, or womb.^[The symbolism of the altar of an Orthodox church as both Eden and womb, with the Theotokos as the sky, is a powerful merging of these symbols.]  The initial act is one of ordering, or creating a place where things are nourished and protected.  All of our making of gardens, whether the palacial or backyard variety, is an image of this ordering.  Similarly, the coagulation of strains of thoughts in books, and the sorting of those books in libraries, is an apprenticeship to the ongoing creation of meaning by Reality.

### Internal: Eating Living Medicine

Information enters into us and changes us, shaping our actions and our bodies: what we decide to ingest or tattoo on ourselves, where we live, who we consider 'safe' or 'dangerous'.  Information is not inert, not a pale pharmaceutical product.  It is closer to the 'plant allies' which we keep in our gardens and which constitute our food and medicine: living things we rely on in any interactive partnership.  In his *Aids to Reflection*, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge advises: "accustom yourself to reflect on the words you use, hear, or read, their birth, derivation and history.  For if words are not THINGS, they are LIVING POWERS, by which the things of most importance to mankind are actuated, combined, and humanized."^[Aids to Reflection, p. 70.] 

While other analogies could certainly be found, Coleridge's description reminds me most of the cooking process: attention to the source of food, combination of ingredients, heating to aid digestion.  And words and other knowledge have been food to me... how many times have I felt empty and been nourished by a line of poetry?  Nourished and given a new mind, as food becomes and replaces our bodies with new matter.

In eastern traditions of Christian monasticism, monks would come to an elder (*geronda*) asking for 'a word' to meditate on and put into practice as though it were a prescription.  And a controlled substance, for that matter: taken with care and fear of misuse.^[One famous story from the *Sayings of the Desert Fathers* relates that "A monk once came to Basil of Caesarea and said, 'Speak a word, Father'; and Basil replied, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart'; and the monk went away at once. Twenty years later he came back, and said, 'Father, I have struggled to keep your word; now speak another word to me'; and he said, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself'; and the monk returned in obedience to his cell to keep that also."]  Anyone who has taken psychotropic medications knows their power to make one feel like a different person, whether for good or ill, and the existence of FDA trials and safety testing at least implicitly acknowledges the trust required for such an intimate act of taking something into our bodies.  Abuses of this trust, as exemplified by Big Tobacco or the Eli Lilly Suicides ^[In which the company went to market with Prozac despite knowing the unnacceptable risk of suicide caused by the drug.  For a medico-legal analysis, [see here](http://breggin.com/wp-content/uploads/1996/01/Website%20Introduction%20to%20documents.pdf).], are rightly vilified.  Equivalent abuses of trust using words and data by companies such as Facebook, have also harmed broad swathes of humanity.^[See, for instance, evidence published in the *Wall Street Journal* that Facebook executives were aware that the site's algorithms "exploit the human brain's attraction to divisiveness" and that “if left unchecked” those algorithms would feed users "more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention".]  This parallel potential of thoughts, medicines, and food to do harm points to an underlying similarity: the intimate relationship of these materials to our selves and bodies when we ingest them.

Both food and medicine are metabolized by the body and become part of the fabric of our bodies. Yet they are both objects of our actions: we find them, prepare them, take them in.  Information can be something we seek and take in as well, but we often come by it far less intentionally.  We are surrounded by it and it enters us almost without our choosing.  Thus billboards, thus banner ads, thus 'marketing impressions.'  Information and thoughts come to us unbidden, and often change us more than we "make use" of them.  In this sense, knowledge is more like a bacteria, or virus.^[William Burroughs' aforementioned essay in *Electronic Revolution*, for instance, claims that the word has evolved to operate as a virus with the human as its host organism, and presciently identifies its dangers when militarized and used for control.]

Bacteria/Virus.  Bacterial when in balance with host, symbiosis.  Viral when false (lacking life/DNA)

### Our Foundational Story

- tree of knowledge is a mingling of good and evil without ability to distinguish: movement from the curated version of the world (garden) to the entirety (forest/wilderness).  This is an image of our condition as both children, arising into the confusion of the world, and as parents preparing our own children to move from the garden of our homes into the wilderness.
- Not possible to tell from knowledge truth from false, only what we can touch, and what is beautiful (cf. Cioran, Milosz' 'One More Day').  From words, the arc of a font, the miniature forest of letters, the taste which ripens in them, hint of a world within the material, twirled to evaporate from the tongue
  
How deeply are the roots of knowing (informational) and being (material) entwined?  To investigate, take a moment to answer the question: "*What am I without my thoughts?*"  Much of the contemporary Western mindset has been influenced by the Cartesian dictum "I think, therefore I am", equating thought with essence. Such abstract thinking has had visceral consequences, leading to the dehumanization of individuals with lower *IQ scores* and even to forced sterility and extermination campaigns of the early 20th century, in both the United States and fascist Europe.  Reflecting on the effects of these in his essay "Learning from the Tyrants", E.M. Cioran describes Adolf Hitler as: 

"*..important not so much in himself as in what he heralds, the rough draft of our future... precursor of that grand-scale despot who will succeed in unifying the world by science, destined not to deliver but to enslave us.  This was understood long ago, it will be understood again one day.  We are born to exist, not to know; to be, not to assert ourselves.  Knowledge, having irritated and stimulated our appetite for power, will lead us inexorably to our ruin.  It is Genesis, not our dreams and our systems, that has perceived our condition.*"^[Cioran, E.M. "Learning from the Tyrants." *History and Utopia.* trans. Richard Howard. University of Chicago Press, 1987.]

Cioran reads the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" from the Genesis myth not as a moral trespass, but as the opening up of a deluge of both truth and the turning away from truth, of good and its twisting. Similarly, theologians from early antiquity interpret knowledge not as something prohibited, but as something requiring wisdom if we are to be innoculated against its danger.

Each time we partake of knowledge, it is like eating again from that primordial tree.  Each headline, each poem, every book and piece of clickbait.  Exposing ourselves to both good and evil, yet barely able any longer to differentiate between the two, which have been cross-fertilized through so many successive generations.

### Designing the Placental Garden

Comparing false knowledge to a 'disease state' allows us to seek a remedy. It also grounds the issue in the tangible world and not the slippery realm of ideas and fictions. (In this regard, the myth of Genesis provides more guidance than the Greek myth of Pandora’s box, which leaves us only with a vague 'hope' once the myriad chimeras are loosed upon the world).

  - Knowledge is messy.  Efforts of last century to provide structure (info theory, library categorization, www) 
  - these efforts superficial. open any web page or book and experience the tangle.  Yet a convincing illusion.
  - Any attempt to structure knowledge presumes a total knowledge of what the total structure is. (cf. Thompson motif index running out of spaces) 
    - Imposing on the collective human imagination a totalizing architecture, like the fascist throroughfares imposed on Rome or Paris' city planning, creates the illusion of a grand order (as opposed to a local symmetry, which is actually the structure of the universe)
      - Compare C. Alexander, designing person-centered and traditional towns...
    - It is telling that no universal language has taken off and started to be used, hinting that there is not a clean symbolic overlay that can be placed above reality.  See: Umberto Eco's "Serendipities"

In an exercise whose futility underscores our inter-relationship with this dataome, Scharf's essay estimates that "the simple act of human arms raising and lowering copies of Shakespeare’s writings has expended well over 4 trillion Joules of energy...equivalent to combusting several hundred thousand kilograms of coal."  There is an outsized physical toll to symbols, however light and compact they may seem.  This recognition, and the even more sizable energy consumption of cat pictures, pornography, and accounting software, leads easily to the question: how might we trim down the size of our data-ome to ensure the survivial of what is best in it?

While it's easy to see how a collective body benefits from certain thoughts or writings (e.g. those which espouse kindness as opposed to greed), each individual person often needs some latitude to discover what is a valuable on their own, and needs access to many other shared experiences in order to test, iterate, and discover what works.  Top-down attempts to curb individual contributions to the data-ome, typically referred to as censorship, risk being implemented based on power interests which would skew knowledge in the favor of a select minority and inadvertently reduce the value which transcribing our thoughts has for us as a people. 

### Personal Measures
  - While control of a total structure is alluringly impossible, personal uses of knowledge (i.e. virus control, medicinal) are possible
  - We can control the degree to which we expose ourselves to, and spread, knowledge. Cf. disease management
  - We can control the degree to which we ingest thoughts, as in meditation or nepsis. Cf. slow food, dieting
    - Not out of fear, but a healthy respect for the power of ideas.  Our structures teach that 'more is better' (e.g. moving from G-PG-R in movies), yet this is more a consumerist mindset than reflective of wisdom.
    - Words/knowledge/culture are not Reality, and ingesting them is not truly fulfilling.  Like hugging a mirror.
  - "It is best to have no thoughts at all." - St. Isaak
    - Appears to fly straight in the face of dogmatists whose lexicon is words and thoughts, used to instruct yet so often also to divide/persecute.
    - Wisest seem to use thoughts as a dissolving ladder, which evaporates as one moves up it.  For God is in the air, and ground, and all.

Disease prevention models include the opportunity for action at both a systemic and individual level.  Confronted with this staggering weight, and the increasing proportion of it which is devoted to the informational equivalent of junk food, Scharf feels impelled to impose informational dietary restrictions, making the case that: "*improving the utility of our data, purging it of energy-wasting junk might not be popular, but could perhaps be incentivized... In that case, the human-dataome symbiosis might become the only example in nature of a symbiotic relationship that is consciously managed by one party.*"  While he identifies opportunities for systemic management of the dataome, such proposals face (as he notes) some steep barriers to adoption. [Clarify disagreement with Scharf here]

On the other hand, the individual method of transmission for this particular virus is surprisingly well-documented.  It has been traversed for centuries by ascetics, who have thankfully documented their struggles to overcome their thoughts.

One of the most cogent of these is Nil Sorsky, whose slim collected writings were recently gifted to me.  A Russian hermit of the 14th century, St. Nil identifies five steps which bring one from entertaining an idea to becoming a host organism for that idea. It's phases, albeit by analogy, mirror fairly closely the stages of a virus: 

**Stages of thought** | Description               | **Stages of virus**  | Description of lytic cycle
--------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------
*Suggestion*          | Exposure to thought       | *Exposure*           |   
*Dialogue*            | Interaction with thought  | *Attachment*         | Bacteriophage attaches to surface  
*Consent*             | Acceptance / yielding     | *Penetration*        | Viral DNA enters host  
*Captive*             | Preoccupied / multiplying | *Biosynthesis*       | Phage DNA replicates  
*Passion*             | Thought fuses w/ identity | *Maturation / Lysis* | Cell releases new phages

Marketing measures of engagement and click-through rates are essentially measures of contagion.

Implementing such a disease reduction strategy would be a life's work, and has been for the ascetics who have undertaken it. It is also made difficult by the fact that not all ideas are only true, and that some do provide nourishment. In this regard the attempt is much like that of individuals who are addicted to food, and who therefore must daily face and ingest the substance which is a psychological poison to them.

Because of this, Saint Isaac the Syrian cautions that "having no thoughts is better than having good thoughts."


### Communal Garden: A Local Approach to Preserving Meaning

  - There is a middle point between total, impersonal control and individual ascesis.  This includes personal interactions, like reading poems to another person, talking about life, etc.
  - Tending a collective garden is the work of a gardener.  The librarian-gardener test the pH, keeps a mix of compost, plants synergistic plants beside one another.  Is selective in what is shared.  Lovingly tends.
