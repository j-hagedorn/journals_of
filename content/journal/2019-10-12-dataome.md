Maybe it derives from a life saturated by the Christian notion of the *Word made flesh*.  Maybe it comes from a desire to reconcile my fascination with symbols and simultaneously with the ungovernable sea of stuff surrounding me.  Perhaps it arises from any number of other strands whose weaving-needles clack at the base of my cerebellum.  I'm not sure.  Nevertheless, I've always been drawn to ways of thinking about words which inhabit an uneasy space between symbolic and raw material.

The notion of the word as virus in Burroughs,^[see Burroughs, W.S. [Electronic Revolution](http://www.ubu.com/historical/burroughs/electronic_revolution.pdf), 1970.] compelled me when I first read it, as have the various myths in which words manifest themselves upon flowers, and now the  current work in the field of biosemiotics: all of these strike a chord in me which I simultaneously savor and fear is ridiculous.

### Not 'the cloud', but a placenta

This trope recently re-surfaced in my "feed"^[i.e. internet trough] in the form of an essay on "*the selfish Dataome*" by Caleb Scharf, an astrophysicist.^[See Scharf, C. [The Selfish Dataome](http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/the-selfish-dataome). *Nautilus*, Issue 065: In Plain Sight.]  In it, Scharf argues that the human race might usefully be conceived of as a supporting organelle for its own *dataome*: a portmanteau he defines as "the data outside of our biological selves."  

References to created artifacts having their own life, independent of the biological existence of their makers, have been around for a long time. Recall Horace’s "Life is short, art is long."  But contrasting art with life doesn't do justice to their inter-penetration: the ways in which art insinuates itself into life, which in turn pollinates other art, and so on.  Shakespeare’s sonnet 18 gets closer to articulating this symbiosis, with its closing promise that "so long lives this, and this gives life to thee."  Anything that *lives*, whether literally or figuratively, requires organization and maintenance, requires energy.

In an exercise whose futility underscores our inter-relationship with this data-ome, the essay estimates that "the simple act of human arms raising and lowering copies of Shakespeare’s writings has expended well over 4 trillion Joules of energy...equivalent to combusting several hundred thousand kilograms of coal."  There is an outsized physical toll to symbols, however light and compact they may seem.  This recognition, and the even more sizable energy consumption of cat pictures, pornography, and accounting software, leads easily to the question: how might we trim down the size of our data-ome to ensure the survivial of what is best in it?

While it's easy to see how a collective body benefits from certain thoughts or writings (e.g. those which espouse kindness as opposed to greed), each individual person often needs some latitude to discover what is a valuable on their own, and needs access to many other shared experiences in order to test, iterate, and discover what works.  Top-down attempts to curb individual contributions to the data-ome, typically referred to as censorship, risk being implemented based on power interests which would skew knowledge in the favor of a select minority and inadvertently reduce the value which transcribing our thoughts has for us as a people. 

### I am not what I think

We can sense how deeply the roots of knowing and being are entwined, merely by trying to answer the question "*What are we without our thoughts?*"  Much of the contemporary Western mindset has been influenced by the Cartesian dictum "I think, therefore I am", equating thought with essence. Such abstract thinking has had visceral consequences, leading to the dehumanization of individuals with lower *IQ scores* and even to forced sterility and extermination campaigns of the early 20th century, in both the United States and fascist Europe.  Reflecting on the effects of these in his essay "Learning from the Tyrants", E.M. Cioran describes Hitler as: 

".*..important not so much in himself as in what he heralds, the rough draft of our future... precursor of that grand-scale despot who will succeed in unifying the world by science, destined not to deliver but to enslave us.  This was understood long ago, it will be understood again one day.  We are born to exist, not to know; to be, not to assert ourselves.  Knowledge, having irritated and stimulated our appetite for power, will lead us inexorably to our ruin.  It is Genesis, not our dreams and our systems, that has perceived our condition.*"^[Cioran, E.M. "Learning from the Tyrants." *History and Utopia.* trans. Richard Howard. University of Chicago Press, 1987.]

Cioran reads the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" from the Genesis myth not as a moral trespass, but as the opening up of a deluge of both truth and the turning away from truth, of good and it’s twisting. Similarly, theologians from early antiquity interpret knowledge not as something prohibited, but as something requiring wisdom if we are to be innoculated against its danger.

To frame our resistance to unreality as an innoculation echoes other thinkers' framing of the word as a virus. Burroughs' aforementioned essay, for instance, claims that the word has evolved to operate as a virus with the human as its host organism. While this seems extreme^[and Burroughs immediately begins to think about it as a method for control and militarization], the basis on which he founds this comparison is compelling.  Raptured by the novelty of electronic media, Burroughs mistakes this aspect of the word as a new phenomenon whose advent coincides with the electronic revolution.  Coming decades later and having acclimated to the digital, Scharf’s definition of the dataome takes a longer view.  For him, the data-ome encompasses all human representation of thoughts, and thus goes all the way back to cave paintings and myths in the oral tradition. It also broadens the notion of “word” to include any artifact which represents a thought: that is, any data which is the representational exhaust of human thinking and knowledge.

Comparing false knowledge to a 'disease state' allows us to seek a remedy. It also grounds the issue in the tangible world and not the slippery realm of ideas and fictions. (In this regard, the myth of Genesis provides more guidance than the Greek myth of Pandora’s box, which leaves us only with a vague 'hope' once the myriad chimeras are loosed upon the world).

### A Local Approach to Preserving Meaning

Disease prevention models include the opportunity for action at both a systemic and individual level.  Confronted with this staggering weight, and the increasing proportion of it which is devoted to the informational equivalent of junk food, Scharf feels impelled to impose informational dietary restrictions, making the case that: "*improving the utility of our data, purging it of energy-wasting junk might not be popular, but could perhaps be incentivized... In that case, the human-dataome symbiosis might become the only example in nature of a symbiotic relationship that is consciously managed by one party.*"  While he identifies opportunities for systemic management of the dataome, such proposals face (as he notes) some steep barriers to adoption.

On the other hand, the individual method of transmission for this particular virus is surprisingly well-documented.  It has been traversed for centuries by ascetics, who have thankfully documented their struggles to overcome their thoughts.

One of the most cogent of these is Nil Sorsky, whose slim collected writing were recently gifted to me.  A Russian hermit of the 14th century, St. Nil identifies five steps which bring one from entertaining an idea to becoming a host organism for that idea. It's phases, albeit by analogy, mirror fairly closely the stages of a virus: 

**Stages of thought** | Description               | **Stages of virus**  | Description of lytic cycle
--------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------
*Suggestion*          | Exposure to thought       | *Exposure*           |   
*Dialogue*            | Interaction with thought  | *Attachment*         | Bacteriophage attaches to surface  
*Consent*             | Acceptance / yielding     | *Penetration*        | Viral DNA enters host  
*Captive*             | Preoccupied / multiplying | *Biosynthesis*       | Phage DNA replicates  
*Passion*             | Thought fuses w/ identity | *Maturation / Lysis* | Cell releases newly made phages

Implementing such a disease reduction strategy would be a life‘s work, and has been for the ascetics who have undertaken it. It is also made difficult by the fact that Not all ideas are only true, and that some men do provide nourishment. In this regard the attempt is much like that of individuals who are addicted to food, and who therefore must daily face and ingest the substance which is a psychological poison to them.

Because of this, Saint Isaac the Syrian cautions that "having no thoughts is better than having good thoughts."
