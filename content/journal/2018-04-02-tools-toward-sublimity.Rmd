Looking at the way *Self*, *Nature* and the *Sublime* are framed in Romantic-era science, it is intriguing to see how (even in fields supposedly untinged by subjectivity), the medium marinades the message.  It is difficult to imagine any peer-reviewed journal today, for instance, voicing these lines from William Herschel:^[See [Darwin, G. H. (1912). Sir William Herschel. Science.](https://archive.org/stream/jstor-1637819/1637819#page/n9/mode/2up/search/luxuriant+garden)]

> This method of viewing the heavens seems to throw them into a new kind of light. They are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden, which contains the greatest variety of productions in different flourishing beds... we can, as it were, extend the range of our experience to an immense duration

The converse is also true, and some media are inimical to conveying certain types of messages or subjects.  For instance, 

Oil           | Vinegar 
------------- | ------------- 
Syllogisms    | Mysticism        
Koans         | Empirical experiments    
Tweets        | Dramatic monologues

This is not to say that one couldn't rastle these subjects into these forms; but the result would smack more of incongruity, and be read as a *pomo* commentary on the dilution of meaning itself (or some such well-worn theme).

I can't help think (or hope, at least) that much of the erasure of the *Sublime* from scientific discourse following the Romantic period was due to a greater mechanization of method rather than any failure to experimentally verify the *Sublime*.^[Or perhaps not a mechanization of method, but a myopic focus on method ["as if the tidings were the things"](https://www.bartleby.com/101/406.html), with no built in longing for the mysteries referenced.]

In some ways, the humility woven into the scientific method itself might be said to have a kind of sublime ratio of *self::other* at its base.^[It seems sometimes that with each discovery, the new whole of knowledge corresponds to a proportionally greater ignorance.  Ignorance grows exponentially to knowledge.]  The scientific method carries an implicit admission of the sublime baked into it, so that all theories and hypotheses are not considered 'true' so much as 'not yet disproved'. A kind of *via negativa*, through which we know only by approaching, by almost knowing. This recalls the myth of Tantalus, where the fruit of the tree recedes as soon as he grasps it. Or perhaps more aptly that of Apollo and Daphne, in which she turns into a laurel tree as soon as Apollo (*god of rationality and logic*) approaches.

So what kind of tool enables one to approach the sublime? I'll fess up that I want the answer to be something simple... like a pen, descendant of the feathery quill, with its freight of metaphors. After all, one can only approach that which is infinitely weighty if one is unencumbered. Right?  In the case of Humboldt and Herschel, this appears to be far from the case.

Humboldt drags large cases of scientific instruments up mountains, and the native people of Venezuela joke with him about the 'cyanometer' which he uses to measure the blue of the sky on his way up to Mount Chimborazo in the Peruvian Andes. Herschel constructs gigantic lenses for his observatory in the countryside outside of London, where he spent long nights polishing them with a kind of ascetic focus on the medium of understanding.

The tool itself is far from weightless.  And Herschel comes to his notion of the universe as a garden after years and years (and years) of patient observation. The tool becomes slight only with use.  Which is to say that one gains dexterity in using the tool. Which is to say that one begins to have trouble differentiating ones own seeing from the seeing of the tool.  

Perhaps all tools can be tools toward sublimity, provided that they are held in the service of something greater.  Sublimity may *only* be approachable through this intensive use of tools. In poetry, for instance, through pattern and repetition.  It is easy to invoke the Muse, but harder to construct a song. Without attention to the medium, broader claims are untrustworthy; vatic utterances are mere ideology.  I only ever trusted the only opening sentences of Whitman’s song once I had read the lists and tallies.

This happens when we become impatient, when we begin to confuse our tools with the thing that they seek. So we get p-hacking^[Head, M. L., Holman, L., Lanfear, R., Kahn, A. T., & Jennions, M. D. (2015). *The extent and consequences of p-hacking in science.* PLoS biology, 13(3)] in research studies, and an aversion to publishing null results^[Mlinarić, A., Horvat, M., & Šupak Smolčić, V. (2017). *Dealing with the positive publication bias: Why you should really publish your negative results.* Biochemia medica: 27(3), 1-6.], when it is the finding that is valued and not the search.  One might note a similar cheapening of the sublime in the narrative and valuing of conversion experiences in contemporary evangelical Christians, where conversion and assent to a dogmatic "party line" is valued at the expense of walking naked into the infinite. 

Celebrating the triumph of orthodoxy, the survival of icons as tools, or the triumph of science against so I’m not mystery, are both opportunities for hubris.  They must always be seen as tentative, their tension played out in each individual life.

Think of John Donne at the end of his life: *"I tune the instrument here at the door, / And what I must do then, think here before."*^[from ["Hymn to God, My God, in My Sickness"](www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44114), one of Donne's last poems.]  Here, an instrument is a rehearsal for some unimaginable way of seeing up at some higher frequency.  He did not succumb to listening to his own instrument as though it were the world beyond.^[Similarly, Herbert's "church windowes"" both allow and block a view beyond, prefiguring McLuhan's dictum that the *medium is the message* by a few centuries.]  

All tools are infernal machines, which is to say but they are machines to escape her self-centeredness and to mediate the world. Yet we fall in love with the machines themselves and fall back down as in prelest, or delusion.  For example, Giordano Bruno’s ars memoria which was a kind of combination lock to break out of the self.  

Today we are all trapped in with the ancients would have called hell, between the isolation of ourselves in and see the outside world which we hear is only partial and mediated, not merely because of the fallibility of our senses but because it is mediated in its essence, whatever that may be by now.

I want what is greater than all tools, all emotions or medications, all rites and rituals, all images, all maths, all interpretation, formulation, words and music. What holds these in its eye like a dust mote.  And yet I know that I too am perhaps only a tool, a poorly calibrated device which may catch the fleeting reflection of a corner.  

Our tools must show their seams and wires, must carry the coal they use for electricity. Without guile, with all artifice they concoct and none other.
