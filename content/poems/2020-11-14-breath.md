I:  Filling this entrance, I exist  
O:  <font size="2">SO YOU FOLLOW THE MOTION THROUGH</font>  

wind cinched in blinked breaths,  
<font size="2">MOMENT ON MOMENT TO BLOW US OPEN</font>  

brief sky-necklaces  
<font size="2">HOLLOWS & JOINTS UNWOVEN</font>  

stitching this little ring:  
this vivid, evanescent thing.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

<font size="2">NOW THROW YOUR VOICE TO ONGOING</font>  
its rhythm split by will and limits  

<font size="2">GO OUT UNDER STORMS OF ORDER</font>  
wishing this whisper fit  

<font size="2">HOLD YOUR THROAT OVER THE FOLDED ROSE</font>  
between breath's twisting kisses,  

the Spirit's intermittent visits  
<font size="2">SWALLOW THE OCEAN TO SHORE</font>  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

This winter sill: the in-breath grips  
its interests with fists eclipsing sense.  

Treeline of empty stilts.  
<font size="2">THE WARM BONES GONE.  GROUND GROUND.</font>  

<font size="2">MONOTONE CLOUD.  COLD MUD.</font>  
<font size="2">THOSE GORGEOUS, UNGOVERNABLE GODS.</font>  

<font size="2">MOSS BOILS FROM SPORE-SOAKED STONES</font>  
in wild shelters, infested with distances.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

<font size="2">TO CALL TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT ME</font>  
I fill my breath which isn't mine  

<font size="2">SOME PORTION OF THE ZONE OF GHOSTS</font>  
dense essences, these centers entering  

<font size="2">OVER & OVER & OVER</font>  
listening in my ribs  

the wind's revisions delving  
<font size="2">THROUGH A POROUS SOUL.</font>
