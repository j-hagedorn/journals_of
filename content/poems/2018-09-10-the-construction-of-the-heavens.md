Make some use of this.  
In this grand chemical, under the shape of dark  
trace the operations  

of the shining fluid added by the sun upon  
bodies  to which I have  
joined to be divided into two.  

(Draw upon myself without  
attempting to draw to be perceived)  

Form what has been said  
from analogy for the illumination  
which remains in this paper  
of light and luminous vapours,  
of these appearances I carefully  

  build worlds of our own  
  as far as we can (*as far from us*)  

Above the rough surface as  
the square upon  
the ground the birds form  
the unevenness arising  
  out of a thousand situations - 

In possession of a list  
no more than what is sufficiently evident  
as the minute parts  

as I can think  
    *of explaining it by mountains, by admitting large mountains*  
as I have found.  

Add the place.  Make it almost improbable.  
Place *now* and *then*.  
Place *I can only give* on *I need not fear*.  

Form, confining around  
him, the whole universe  
as vivid the diameters - to discover  

the places where, near  
the margin, we form  
an opening to the naked about.  

Extend equally to them all as one  
full grown plant of a crookedly branching  
nebula that would point about  
a center or about  
                    all the spots  

make them mere useless  
brilliant for the dark ground  
about the dark part  
against the moon's being  

*as its satellite we pass*

As I decompose in the suit drawn pretty of stars  
given to it I see  
by some agitation or other in a row a beautiful  
                      
as difficultly resolvable  
                          above construction
