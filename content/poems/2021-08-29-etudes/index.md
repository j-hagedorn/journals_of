A word is sound seeking  
the place of its hearing  

breath-ballast  

forged toward  
the ear in the throat's shell  

* * *  

riven, arrive

* * *  

To do the opposite of covet:  
allude, allure  

strive the path into being,  
hunger until you taste of animals  

* * *  

Do nothing and things  
will be transmuted  

especially  
the phalanx of your doings:  

abyss for god-gestures

* * *  

Alert to scents behind, behind the stars  

(the twintwisting alphabet, leaf-etched messages)  

Mindfold, the deerdark eye  

* * *  

and then

skystalks  
kestrels climb
