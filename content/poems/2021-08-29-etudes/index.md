A word is sound seeking  
the place of its hearing:  

breath-ballast forged toward  
the ear in the throat's shell.  


*
  

riven, arrive



*
  

To do the opposite of covet:  
allude, allure,  

strive the path into being,  
hunger until you taste  
like animals.  


*


Do nothing and things  
will be transmuted,  

especially  
the phalanx of your doings:  

abyss for god-gestures


*


Alert to scents behind stars, behind    

twintwisting alphabets, leaf-etched messages,  

Mindfold, the deerdark eye  


*


and then

skystalks  
kestrels climb


*


This plodding omniscience, not  
to be complete until  
we have inhabited each  

thing, and every  
time, forget.


*


We are earth's  
young it devours through  
their own ravenous kisses.  


*


Goldenrod, your smiling stride  
beside me.  So much light,  
I can only cast shadows inward.  


*


Only what is "mine"  
must be repented  

with rhythm-rutted words, smoothed across tongues,  

what newly beckons  
me never to arrive.


*


Pulse is a quality  
of stars and hearts.  

We come and go.  We  
waver, even while we stay.


*


The receipt is a song,  
in call and response:  

sustenance........ spent energy  
fleet desire...... leaky sacrifice


*


What is a question (of what stuff)  
that pressed into the world, a hint returns?  

What is the world (of what love)  
that it answers?


*


Seeing my children's faces:  
how beautiful I might have been,  
even now.


*


Pleasure and suffering hum at the edges:  

the skin of rain, its swollen voltage.


*


How many leaves  
wrestle through  
their own bodies  
to light  


*


These things have been said before  
but there is no before  

and will be said again  
but there will never be again.  


*


A white moth's petals cling  
to a grass-stem.  

I am not meant  
to be anything.  


*


To be known, touched  
by breeze and the sun  
in the sand.

To be eaten, as to eat.


*


The sea absorbs our feelings, hopes, imaginings.  
How strange it suffers from our negligence.  


*
