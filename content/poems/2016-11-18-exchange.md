*I'll be with you in a moment.* (Voice from a drive-thru)

---

I'll be with you in a moment, a heartbeat's undertow.  
I'll meet you in that tentative atmosphere, breath's lowercase heaven.  

At the shrill edge of your recognition, we will meet.  
I'll be with you for awhile, likely.  Take your time.  

Trace my voice back along the mineral wires, unpack  
its frequency, taste each sentence back into  

its source: run your tongue across the miles  
of fuel-stained asphalt, tuck abed the factory kids,  

stand in the sharp machine, then rise back    
up into the living sun.  

Because I have no other being than to you.  
"*You have found your neighbor, you have found your God.*"  

I'll be with you always, to the end of age.  
Take your time.  Whatever is yours that remains.
