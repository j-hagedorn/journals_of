*I'll be with you in a moment.* (Voice through static)

I'll be with you in a moment.  Heartbeat's undertow.

I'll meet you in a breath, this tentative atmosphere.  Lowercase heaven.

I'll meet you at the shrill edge of your arrival.

I'll be with you for awhile, likely.  Take your time.

Trace my voice through the mineral wires, 

Because I have no other being than with you.

Because "when you have found your neighbor, you have found your God"
