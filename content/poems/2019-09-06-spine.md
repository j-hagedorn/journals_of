What makes the stalk unfold symmetrically?
What intelligence within, contemplating itself,
then turns into direction?

Each stalk, trunk, spine, a trellis
on which petals, arms, eyes bud.

Leaves.

I,
spine, stalk,

The English (Czech, Corsican) first-person pronoun 
Axis on which limbs grow, unshared by others

Such a separate way of writing the self,
as if viewed from without, a column.

In the algorithm which governs growth
of hands, facial symmetry, &c.

there is some starting point for the spine's seed,
akin to 0,0 on a Cartesian grid

But if we are to be a part of the body of the community,
can the central point be within us?
the spine around which we cohere?

"...ancient usage gave the word soul a rather differnt meaning.  The essence of the soul was not so much to be conscious as to govern the formation of the body..." - Santayana (1910), *Three Philosophical Poets*

[In frog eggs, the entry of the sperm redefines the dorso-ventral axis opposite the sperm's entry point]

We are created by the touch of something outside, 
and grow toward it

Not a pillar, not a monument: a column reaching toward others.

"when your eye is single, your whole body is full of light" - Luke 11:34

Seeded by elsewhere, eternity.  We need something outside of us.  cf. Gregory of Sinai, "If we do not know what we were like when God made us, we will not realize what sin has turned us into."

The spine also creaks beneath accumulated weight of reaching, growth,

"the transgression of the commandment was making them turn back again according to their nature; and as they had at the beginning come into being out of non-existence, so were they now on the way to returning, through corruption, to non-existence again." - Athanasius, *On the Incarnation* Ch.1.4

when we swerve from *logos* 

What pulls us up from Kali Yuga, what preserves from entropy,

We come from nothing,
journey from no to yes.
