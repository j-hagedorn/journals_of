*Retell legends*, ebb the embers.  
  Ye, edgeless Essence,  
beget the depthless present tense.  

Excerpted newsreel feeds: Eve errs,  
   etcâ€¦ Serpent repents.  
The expected sentence reversed.  

Hellbent, resplendent, we veer between  
   extremes--never rested,  
we seek new selves.  Keened.  

There there, levees: strewn perplexed  
  where shelter seeps.  
Where tempest extends, recedes, recedes.  

Elements render them defenseless:  speech  
   freezes, nerves tremble,  
vessels wreck.  Flesh bleeds elements.  

Speech fetters. Verse tethers. Yet  
  we seek Thee  
trenched there, seeded between letters.  

Ye rest, pretend, engender spheres,  
  bejewel deserts, beget  
the breeze-sketched trees.  Preserve them.  

We beseech Thee, Nether-Nested:  
  dwell deep here  
delve green between the temples  
    
Be present.  Be here.  Be  
  dented where we  
met.  Be felt there yet.
