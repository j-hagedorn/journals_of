προσκομιδή


Past the sky-shellac, where ancients  
pictured viscous waters, *it* is empty.  
It barely is.  

A lone atom glides there, mutely  
hails its nearest neighbor centuries away  
hairless as a diagram until  
they hisce and spindle and congeal  
from next to nothing into sympathy.  

Lives emerge through each other, plaited,  
sheathed into their generations--we who  
can do nothing but tiptoe, intent,  
whose ground is elsewhere--a tug  
embrangling our lusts and sorrows  
up the hissing sweep of radiance.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

The vasts accrete between and within  
us even now and we cannot  
traverse them or do otherwise.  

Words never said, or said askew  
(*I resent you*, *I love you*)  
Nights where a glacier of sheets  
horizoned the bed, our clenched forms  
islands knotted on the far rims.  

I filled that space with shards  
of me that you might love  
and gnawed my fingers, rushing through  
the feast of days as though  
anxious to become a ghost, or  
fully appear, a mild-flavored air.  

You await, these decades, my arrival.  

Pounding my chest, your teeth against  
my collarbone, your eyes across  
the unrelenting room.  You hold me  
in your body, honey and clove:  
a humid fire, ember of flesh  
on which my ashes tremble, rest.  

These signs and thoughts not mine:  
mine only to surrender, a whisper  
made resonous, carried on your tongue.  

Gather me in your decisive hands.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Before I could see, I needed  
to be seen.  Beheld so carefully  
the bruises ripened, turned to birthmarks,  
their depths summoned up.  I'm here.  

Faces arise from atoms again  
# wanting to be known
again again again--eyestalks of snails,  
the smiling gums of wooly dogs--  
come from the human-scented distances,  
surface to coherence, given simple names  
"squirrel", "orchid", "squid", and nodded  
"good": a synonym for gathering.

We stare and we savor and  
cannot digest the sweat-creased earth,  
the plural irreducibly within each unity.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

I say *we* only to call  
to this compound creature I'm become.  

Voice interrupted, open to the turn.  

We hate it when we tell  
each other what to do. Contrarian,  
as difficult as light, as unresolvable.
