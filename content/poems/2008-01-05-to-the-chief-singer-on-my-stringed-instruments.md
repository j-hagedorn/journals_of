Through fire I choke to raise in song  
orisons from a burning crux;  
Through smoke I aspire to sense, up  
helical stairways, firmer touch.  

Earth’s heft I press against to leave  
constraints of weight below, &  
heave my thin soul heaven-ward  
into austerer circlings.  

Earth’s heft I press against to leave  
fadeable impressions of my soul  
stamped here, on flesh, because  
I know no other place for love.  

Nature embroiders with debris and  
graves our bloom with its undoing;  
entropic floræ of the spring cannot  
restring the nerves’ route to outpace  
our saving fears with gentlenesse.  

Nature embroiders with debris in  
me, dissonating skin from thought,  
yet I must hold the loosenings  
stringently, as in a crystal fugue,  
to resonate with your arrival.  

Restring my mind: a web whose song  
I muffle, hungry, perched at center.  
Nail our cords from agues to ægis: a  
green guitar to play the tensions out.  

*Except the grain delves into earth and*  
*dies, it is itself—alone; but if it dies*  
*it brings forth unimaginable fruit.*  
Nail me through myself and into  
soil, changed. *Selah*.  

Through vague meridians I must come,  
restrung beyond poles of yes or no  
until my brittle, wandering will be  
made into your music, sacrificed.  

Except in others, I can never sing, so  
nail me to my enemy; his voice  
through my own lips articulating  
*Selah*.
