Forgetfulness is part of the design.

It allows for lightness

so that time's gradient texture leans
softer into sight

as whispered portions of a sketch, made voluble 
by revisitation,
by dwelling among.

Forgetting loosens the edges of a too-taut 

else we would carry sheaves
of puzzle pieces which could not fit 
except the gridlocked space we found them.

Overfit, meaning that which fits only in the single place it is, immobile.

No resemblance.  No analogy.  No hope.

Each thing itself only continual alone.



God is composing the earth with emptiness, spaces  

with inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid) in the hippocampus^[Schmitz, T. W., Correia, M. M., Ferreira, C. S., Prescot, A. P., & Anderson, M. C. (2017).

"You brought me out into spaciousness" says the Prophet.

As in the paintings of Guo Xi, who 
"On days when he was going to paint... 
would seat himself at a clean table, by a bright window, burning incense to right and left... 
would choose the finest brushes, the most exquisite ink; wash his hands, and clean 
the ink-stone, as though he were expecting 
a visitor of rank. He waited until his mind was calm and undisturbed, and then began."^[The painter's son, quoted by Arthur Waley in "Chinese Philosophy of Art-IV" in Burlington Magazine, vol. xxxviii, No. ccxviii, p. 247 in Jenyns, Soame. A Background to Chinese Painting. New York: Schocken Books, 1966, p. 134]


Forgiveness lets us view 
each other in an ever-opening light, a grace


The world in its infinitude cannot be held.

Fractals are infinite.  They cannot 'exist'  
until one zooms.

I stare at your infinitely beautiful face before you wake.
The freckles multiplying

It is only as you touch me, I am created.

cf. "you take away your hand and all things are troubled"
