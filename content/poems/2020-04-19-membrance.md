Forgetfulness is part of the design:  

allows for lightness: lacunae in the  
mind, as air in bird-bones:  

How materials attain, through Time's slow  
texture, entrance into my gradient sight  

as whispered portions of a sketch  
made voluble by revisitation, dwelling among.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Forgetting softens the too-taut forms  
of what is irreplaceable

(Elderly dating in nursing homes; Barthes' 'science of the individual')

A planetary museum, pieces which fit  
the base of only one shadow.  

*Overfit*, meaning that which aligns merely  
with the single place it is, immobile.  

No resemblance.  No analogy.  No hope.  
Each only thing itself continual alone.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

But if we are glimpsed with forgetfulness, are we touched?  
The forgetful algorithms run their fingers over our faces all day and night.

Roll us into an abstraction.  

I want to leave a clear hole, laser-cut.
But the world keeps poring in, and inattention.
Even I cannot say quite where I am, even now.

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Arise O God, compose the earth  
with emptiness, epiphanies, with great plains  

and γ-aminobutyric acid: says the Prophet,  
*You brought me out into spaciousness*:  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

We walk, as through a scroll  
of Kuo Hsi, through excruciating resolutions  

peeking out from zones of fog,  
seeking out a place to rest.

The painter would seat himself beside

a clean table, a bright window, and  
with incense burning, rinse his hands  

and inkstone, select the deepest inks,  
as if awaiting a visitor of rank:  

having waited for his mind to clear,
he began to paint those spaces,

sometimes with water, sometimes in air.

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Forgiveness lets us view each other  
in ever-opening light, a grace
limber to 

The world in its infinitude cannot be held.

Fractals may be infinite, yet can't 'exist'  
til one approaches them.

It is the approach which makes the infinite, uncovers it.

I stare into your infinite face  
some Saturday mornings, before you wake.

The freckles stippling

It is only as you touch me, I am created.

*You take away your hand and all things are troubled*

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Remembering has its opposite in dismembering.  

To remember is to fasten one's  
dust to the body of Reality,  

a single scale or mossy flank
as it oxbows through time, leviathan,

Forgetfulness guards against atrophy, fosters growth

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

"One who has perfected... the twin arts of remembering and forgetting is in a position to play at battledore and shuttlecock with the whole of existence."^[Bretall, R. W., Kierkegaard, S. (1959). A Kierkegaard Anthology. NY: Modern Library.]

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Forgetfulness comes bearing its inconceivable coordinates.  

The exquisite precision of objects lost  
whose intricate outline is equally lost 

having traced from the world's lineaments  
their painstaking cross-hatching and edges.

Reality remembers everything.

The snowflake's spoke melted to globe 
in a tree's green hand, reflects 
a knobbed branch, a convex sky,  
my color-hungry & -forgetful eyes.

Each nutrient through each blessed hair 
upon my son's exhausted head.  
The smell of his blue blanket.

Each taste within the throat  
will be recollected.

Nothing is lost.  

No mundane joy or consequential pain.
Each of our goings, spacious and precise,  

recalled, as in some naming of the beasts
which greets each fermion and boson, each 

moment gliding light across our yard, 
across each leaf, across each nerve

cell strewn across the corresponding minds
of moth or squirrel or cardinal.

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Clogged with material, how does Reality  
haul into the waiting moment's frame?  

How does it thread the red-winged  
blackbird through the thicket yet again?  

Newness is the oldest thing it does.  

*If you would enter...become as children.*

Time seethes through the forest gaps,  
making each creature new as ever  

up to the very moment: ancient  
as the nimble days we imitate:  

braiding with small hands the threads  
we cannot follow back, old themes  

of a garden shaped from nothing,  
of limits limned within the limitless:

the narrow path tracing a ridge  
which veers each way into immensity,  

the scant expanse of frequencies  
which our perceptions brush, bewildered  
as a peak through noctilucent clouds,  

the elegant footprint of a theorem amid
those sprawling instances which it explains,  
purports to explain  *...I will put*  

*you in a cleft of rock and cover you*

The theme is an ascetic one,
of growing thinner to thicken Reality.

It says the more precipituous foothold 
yields a greater view.

Perspective requires that we cannot touch.
