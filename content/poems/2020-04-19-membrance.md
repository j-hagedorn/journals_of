Forgetfulness is part of the design:
allows for lightness: lacunae in the  
mind, as air in bird-bones:  

materials attain, through Time's texture 
entrance into my gradient sight

as whispered portions of a sketch, made voluble 
by revisitation, dwelling among.

Forgetting softens the forms of a too-taut 

else we would carry sheaves
of puzzle pieces which could not fit 
except the gridlocked space we found them.

*Overfitted*, meaning that which aligns only  
with the single place it is, immobile.  

No resemblance.  No analogy.  No hope.

Each thing itself only continual alone.



God is composing the earth with emptiness, spaces  

with inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid) in the hippocampus^[Schmitz, T. W., Correia, M. M., Ferreira, C. S., Prescot, A. P., & Anderson, M. C. (2017). Hippocampal GABA enables inhibitory control over unwanted thoughts. Nature communications, 8(1), 1311. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-00956-z]

"You brought me out into spaciousness" says the Prophet.

As in the paintings of Guo Xi, who 
"On days when he was going to paint... 
would seat himself at a clean table, by a bright window, burning incense to right and left... 
would choose the finest brushes, the most exquisite ink; wash his hands, and clean 
the ink-stone, as though he were expecting 
a visitor of rank. He waited until his mind was calm and undisturbed, and then began."^[The painter's son, quoted by Arthur Waley in "Chinese Philosophy of Art-IV" in Burlington Magazine, vol. xxxviii, No. ccxviii, p. 247 in Jenyns, Soame. A Background to Chinese Painting. New York: Schocken Books, 1966, p. 134]

Forgiveness lets us view 
each other in an ever-opening light, a grace
limber to 

The world in its infinitude cannot be held.

Fractals are infinite.  They cannot 'exist'  
until one zooms.

I stare at your infinite face before you wake.
The freckles stippling

It is only as you touch me, I am created.

cf. "you take away your hand and all things are troubled"

memor > remembrer > remember
membrum > desmembrer > dismember

Remembering has its opposite in dismembering
To remember is to join some greater body, rolling serpentine through time,

Forgetfulness guards against atrophy, fosters growth

"One who has perfected... the twin arts of remembering and forgetting is in a position to play at battledore and shuttlecock with the whole of existence."^[Bretall, R. W., Kierkegaard, S. (1959). A Kierkegaard Anthology. NY: Modern Library.]

Inconceivable, that even forgetfulness has its coordinates
exquisite precision each excision
mirrors the lineaments of the world, 
its painstaking cross-hatching and edges

Reality remembers everything.

The snowflake's spoke expanding to a globe 
in a leaf's palm, reflecting a knobbed branch,
a convex sky, my color-hungry & -forgetful eyes.

Each atom pulsing through each blessed hair 
upon my son's exhausted head.  Each taste within the throat  
will be recollected.

Nothing is lost.  
No pain or joy or mundane morning.

Each of our goings, spacious and precise

Recalled, as in some naming of the beasts
which greets each fermion and boson, each 
moment gliding light across our yard, 
across each leaf, across each nerve
and corresponding mind
of moth or squirrel or cardinal


---

Clogged with material and minute history, 
how does Reality haul
its cumbrous mass into the next moment's frame?
How does it thread the red-winged
blackbird through the thicket yet again?  

Newness is the oldest thing it does.

Time seethes through the spaces in the forest,
making each creature new unto the moment
as always, 

ancient as the nimble days 
we imitate.

*if you would enter...become like little children*

braiding its moments (criss-cross-applesauce)


holding with stuttering hands
threads whose source we cannot trace,
innumerable old themes

...like the theme of limits within the limitless.

The narrow path tracing a ridge
which staggers both ways to immensity.

The scant expanse of frequencies
which brushes our perception, bewildered
as a peak into luminescent clouds

*and I will put you in a cleft of rock and I will cover you*

The elegant footprint of a theorem amid
the sprawling instances which it explains,
purports to explain. 

The theme is an ascetic one,
of growing thinner that Reality may thicken.

It says the more precipituous our foothold 
the greater our view,

Perspective requires that we cannot touch.
