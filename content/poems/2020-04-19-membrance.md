Forgetfulness is part of the design.

It allows for lightness

so that time's gradient texture leans
softer into sight

as whispered portions of a sketch, made voluble 
by revisitation,
by dwelling among.

Forgetting loosens the edges of a too-taut 

else we would carry sheaves
of puzzle pieces which could not fit 
except the gridlocked space we found them.

Overfit, meaning that which fits only in the single place it is, immobile.

No resemblance.  No analogy.  No hope.

Each thing itself only continual alone.



God is composing the earth with emptiness, spaces  

with inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid) in the hippocampus^[Schmitz, T. W., Correia, M. M., Ferreira, C. S., Prescot, A. P., & Anderson, M. C. (2017). Hippocampal GABA enables inhibitory control over unwanted thoughts. Nature communications, 8(1), 1311. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-00956-z]

"You brought me out into spaciousness" says the Prophet.

As in the paintings of Guo Xi, who 
"On days when he was going to paint... 
would seat himself at a clean table, by a bright window, burning incense to right and left... 
would choose the finest brushes, the most exquisite ink; wash his hands, and clean 
the ink-stone, as though he were expecting 
a visitor of rank. He waited until his mind was calm and undisturbed, and then began."^[The painter's son, quoted by Arthur Waley in "Chinese Philosophy of Art-IV" in Burlington Magazine, vol. xxxviii, No. ccxviii, p. 247 in Jenyns, Soame. A Background to Chinese Painting. New York: Schocken Books, 1966, p. 134]


Forgiveness lets us view 
each other in an ever-opening light, a grace
limber to 

The world in its infinitude cannot be held.

Fractals are infinite.  They cannot 'exist'  
until one zooms.

I stare at your infinite face before you wake.
The freckles stippling

It is only as you touch me, I am created.

cf. "you take away your hand and all things are troubled"

memor > remembrer > remember
membrum > desmembrer > dismember

Remembering has its opposite in dismembering
To remember is to join some greater body, rolling serpentine through time,

Forgetfulness guards against atrophy, allows for growth

"One who has perfected... the twin arts of remembering and forgetting is in a position to play at battledore and shuttlecock with the whole of existence."^[Bretall, R. W., Kierkegaard, S. (1959). A Kierkegaard Anthology. NY: Modern Library.]

Inconceivable, that even forgetfulness has its coordinates
exquisite precision each excision
shares the lineaments of the world, 
its painstaking cross-hatching and edges

Reality remembers everything.

The snowflake's spoke expanding to a globe 
in a leaf's palm, reflecting a branch,
a convex sky, my hungry & forgetful eyes.

Each atom pulsing through each blessed hair 
upon my son's exhausted head.  Each taste within the throat  
will be recollected.
