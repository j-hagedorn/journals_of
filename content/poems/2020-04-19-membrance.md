Forgetfulness is part of the design:  

allows for lightness: lacunae in the  
mind, as air in bird-bones:  

How materials attain, through Time's slow  
texture, entrance into my gradient sight  

as whispered portions of a sketch  
made voluble by revisitation, dwelling among.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Forgetting softens the too-taut forms  
of what is irreplaceable

(Elderly dating in nursing homes; Barthes 'science of the individual')

A planetary museum, pieces which fit  
the base of only one shadow.  

*Overfit*, meaning that which aligns merely  
with the single place it is, immobile.  

No resemblance.  No analogy.  No hope.  
Each only thing itself continual alone.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

But if we are glimpsed with forgetfulness, are we touched?  
The forgetful algorithms run their fingers over our faces all day and night.

Roll us into an abstraction.  

I want to leave a clear hole, precise and laser-cut.
But the world keeps poring in, and inattention.
Even I cannot say quite where I am, even now.

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Arise O God, compose the earth  
with emptiness, with epiphanies, great plains  

and γ-aminobutyric acid: says the Prophet,  
*You brought me out into spaciousness*:  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

We walk, as through a scroll  
of Kuo Hsi, through excruciating resolutions  

peeking out from zones of fog,  
seeking out a place to rest.

The painter would seat himself beside

a clean table, a bright window, and  
with incense burning, rinse his hands  

and inkstone, select the deepest inks,  
as if awaiting a visitor of rank:  

having waited for his mind to clear,
he began to paint the spaces,

sometimes with water, sometimes in air.

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Forgiveness lets us view each other  
in an ever-opening light, a grace
limber to 

The world in its infinitude cannot be held.

Fractals may be infinite, yet can't 'exist'  
til one approaches them.

I stare into your infinite face  
some Saturday mornings, before you wake.

The freckles stippling

It is only as you touch me, I am created.

*You take away your hand and all things are troubled*

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Remembering has its opposite in dismembering.  
To remember is to fasten ones'  

dust to the body of Reality,  
a single scale or mossy flank

as it oxbows through time, leviathan,

Forgetfulness guards against atrophy, fosters growth

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

"One who has perfected... the twin arts of remembering and forgetting is in a position to play at battledore and shuttlecock with the whole of existence."^[Bretall, R. W., Kierkegaard, S. (1959). A Kierkegaard Anthology. NY: Modern Library.]

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Forgetfulness comes, bearing its inconceivable coordinates.  

Exquisite precision of each thing lost  
whose intricate outline is equally lost 

having traced among the world's lineaments,  
its painstaking cross-hatching and edges.

Reality remembers everything.

The snowflake's spoke expanding to a globe 
in a leaf's palm, reflecting a knobbed branch,
a convex sky,  
my color-hungry & -forgetful eyes.

Each nutrient through each blessed hair 
upon my son's exhausted head.  

The smell of his blue blanket.

Each taste within the throat  
will be recollected.

Nothing is lost.  
No pain or joy or mundane morning.

Each of our goings, spacious and precise,  

recalled, as in some naming of the beasts
which greets each fermion and boson, each 

moment gliding light across our yard, 
across each leaf, across each nerve

in corresponding minds
of moth or squirrel or cardinal

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Clogged with material and minute history,  
how does Reality haul  
its cumbrous mass into the next moment's frame?  

How does it thread the red-winged  
blackbird through the thicket yet again?  

Newness is the oldest thing it does.  

Time seethes through the forest gaps,  
making each creature new as ever  

up to the very moment: ancient  
as the nimble days we imitate.  

*if you would enter...become like little children*

braiding its moments (criss-cross-applesauce)


braiding with small hands
threads whose source we cannot trace,  
innumerable old themes

...like the theme of limits within the limitless.

The narrow path tracing a ridge  
which veers both ways into immensity.  

The scant expanse of frequencies  
which brushes our perception, bewildered  
as a peak into luminescent clouds  

*and I will put you in a cleft of rock and I will cover you*

The elegant footprint of a theorem amid
the sprawling instances which it explains,  
purports to explain.  

The theme is an ascetic one,
of growing thinner that Reality may thicken.

It says the more precipituous our foothold 
the greater our view,

Perspective requires that we cannot touch.
