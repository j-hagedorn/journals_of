*One who has perfected... the twin arts of remembering and*  
*forgetting is in a position to play at battledore and *  
*shuttlecock with the whole of existence.*  

--SK, *Journals*

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Forgetfulness is part of the design:  

allows for lightness: lacunae in the  
mind, as air in bird-bones:  

How materials attain, through Time's slow  
texture, entrance to our gradient sight  

as whispered portions of a sketch  
made voluble by visitation, dwelt among.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Forgetting softens the too-taut forms  
of what is irreplaceable.  And gone.  

(cf. the dating scene in nursing homes)  
Without it, the planet becomes an  

ill-tended museum, each work fitting  
the base of only one shadow:  

*Overfit*, meaning that which goes merely  
in the single place it is, immobile.  

Without resemblance. Or analogy.  Or hope.  
Each only thing itself continual alone.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

The individual is dead.  The abstraction  
is perpetual transit.  We want touch.  

The transitory algorithms finger our faces  
day and night, wield our nakedness  

into a perfect obscurity of number.  
We will all be translated.  So  

I want to leave a hole  
like a nest framing the air:  

daubed and bent by your hands,  
a halo you can stand within  
of scraps meticulously twirled

a haven for you.  I want  
to be the home I've sought,  

will maybe always seek,  
which keeps me restless even now,  

*Let us attend.*  Remember me.

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Arise O God, compose the earth  
with emptiness, epiphanies, with great plains  

and γ-aminobutyric acid: says the Prophet,  
*You brought me out into spaciousness*:  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

We walk, as through a scroll  
of Kuo Hsi, through excruciating resolutions  

peeking out from zones of fog,  
seeking out a place to rest.

The painter would seat himself beside  
a clean table, a bright window, and  

with incense burning, rinse his hands  
and inkstone, select the deepest inks,  

as if awaiting a visitor of rank:  
having waited for his mind to clear,  

he started to paint those spaces,  
sometimes with water, sometimes in air.

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Up a slope white with flowers  
one petal is creased, dog-eared.  

What are you trying to remember?

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

The opposite of *remember* is *dismember*.  



A memory fastens into me into  
the turbulent body of Reality,  

as it oxbows through time, leviathan,  

to keep some portion of the myriad fact congealed

Forgiveness guards against atrophy, fosters growth.

It lets us view each Other  
in enfolding light, a limber grace.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

We know the never-resting world  
cannot be held.  Sit with me.  

Fractals are limitless, yet don't *exist*  
until a viewer clicks and zooms.

It is the approach which  
incites infinity, reaching to uncover it.

I stare into your eternal face  
some Saturdays, awake before you wake.

Stone eyelids, florescent scatter of freckles,  
pores stippling from a humid core.

You touch me, I am created.  
*You take away your hand and...*

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Forgetfulness comes bearing  
its inconceivable coordinates.  

The exquisite precision of objects lost  
whose intricate outline is equally lost 

having traced from the world's lineaments  
their painstaking cross-hatching and edges.  

Reality remembers everything:  

the snowflake's spoke melted to globe  
in a tree's green hand, reflects

a knobbed branch, a convex sky,  
my color-hungry & -forgetful eyes.

Each nutrient through each blessed hair  
upon my son's exhausted head.  

The smell of his blue blanket.

Each taste within the throat  
will be recollected.  Nothing is lost.  

No mundane joy or consequential pain.  
Each of our goings, spacious and precise,  

recalled, as in some naming of the beasts  
which greets each fermion and boson, each  

moment gliding light across our yard,  
across each leaf, across each nerve  

cell strewn across the corresponding minds  
of moth or squirrel or cardinal.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Clogged with material, how does Reality  
haul into the waiting moment's frame?  

How does it thread the red-winged  
blackbird through the thicket yet again?  

Newness, the oldest thing it does.  
*Come in... become as a child.*

Time seethes through the forest gaps,  
making each creature new as ever  

up to the very moment: ancient  
as the nimble days we imitate:  

braiding with small hands the threads  
we cannot follow back, old themes  

of a garden shaped from nothing,  
of limits limned within the limitless:

the narrow path tracing a ridge  
which veers each way into immensity,  

the scant expanse of frequencies  
which our perception brushes, bewildered  

as a peak through noctilucent clouds,  

the elegant footprint of a theorem amid  
those sprawling instances which it explains,  

purports to explain  *...I will put*  
*you in a cleft of rock...*

The theme is an ascetic one,  
of growing thinner to thicken Reality.

It says the more precipituous foothold  
yields a greater view.  It says,  

perspective requires that we cannot touch.  
Death's wormhole zero is the garden gate.

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Knowledge requires mercy we cannot bear  
to give.  Love offers us forgetfulness.  

Only those living idiots, the lambs,  
Alzheimers patients, or heedless children

clear of tact or tactics step  
smiling past the fire-sworded seraphim  

holding the body of God
light [as a thing in common]
