*"Why are you on this way?" "So that I may return where I am."*  

(Purgatorio 2.90)  

---

My soul has leached into my skin.  
Raw, haunted.  Prayers become clouds  
of breath across an icon's varnish.  

On a good day my thoughts rest  
on the grass like shadows of grass,  
blade by blade by blade.  

I am trying to understand — in  
a basic sense: to be beneath,  
or even to be with  

To run a hand along the branching  
walls of ancient cities  
as a way to know that I exist.  

To mouth, like wind across  
doorways, each voluble syllable.  

Not to be bewitched by thoughts.  

To handle stones: earth’s braille  
scraping my fingerprints,  
swallow touch into rough sense.  

In an image blacked by candle  
smoke, You press one finger  
to another finger.  

Some nights, a child-me would pinch  
his miniature self, another room,  
and on and on: compacted into sleep.  

The storied worlds have looked their sights  
away.  The only faith I try—  

A finger, pointing to  
a finger, pointing.  

The pinch of something touching back.  

Bless this.
