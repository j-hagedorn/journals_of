Itinerant, these threads appear amid the weave  
this sturdy-seeming life affords; aureal strands  
intervalled to salience from the drab; a dance  
not understood by us, but done. *Example*: Leaves’  
eternal shuttling between the branches & the worm;  
renewed by death into the echelons, they return.  

Ahistorical, we don’t notice the old currents’ return,  
new as a day where antique generations weave  
their hopeful accidents. Nonetheless, we learn  
to hang together. *Cords knit with many strands*  
*hold tight*, the ancients say and, if we try to leave,  
entwine their arms in ours, inviting us to dance.  

Sleuthing truths in books, the worn words dance  
erratic in my eyes until the scales of sense return  
to weigh proportions. We forage in quarto leaves  
hoping for complex fruit among the rhythm’s weave  
revealed, for lasting names to write upon the strands  
Elsewhere, where seriphs hold the boundaries & burn.  

All of our futures have been decided. A heavy burin  
draws the lines, & yet imbues them with that dance  
suffusing any partial thing. Fate, unfurling, strands  
all of us in separate whorls, unable outward to return.  
Perhaps my life’s isolated thread gleams in the weave.  
Perhaps it doesn’t. Can I unstitch myself & leave?  

Eventually every lovely thing must leave
aside what shapeliness our touchings can discern
—raw silk of skin beneath the starry weave—
and make its dwindling bed amid the garden’s *danse*
*macabre*. My threadbare selvage even shall return
into new habits, knit from its own unraveled strands.

Day by layered day, I spin my crimson trail of strands  
through citygrid, among the slowly coming leaves.  
Here, steeped in the concrete, trampled days return  
excavating me, leaving no scab unturned.  
We live in our own ruins, labyrinthine dances,  
entering knots we pray we can unweave.  

All that we’ve felt is a fray of fumbled strands  
veering into textured dance. The needle, hiding, leaves  
ever to sojourn back behind the tapestry, and to return.
