Another day, these double-dozen heads it dregs aloft again,  
nodding or shaking; candelabra which some vital wind,  

obscured behind the quivered bulk of vision, whisper-flicks  
this way, or that, or else some other, as the chance elects.  

Heavy with self, one glimpses mostly that. What is of use?  
Enlarge my empire, its flourished thoroughfares, loose  

runnels clogged sclerotic with expanding self to fill these  
days, this garbage heap of presents only half-received.  

Abstraction is born on day’s conveyor-belt; repetitive stress  
yawning out again its regimen of fractal chintz, except  

that mind’s kaleidoscopic twists craft vistas, infinite,  
hewn views from changeling oils: beaded, coursed and lit.  

Each triggerhair of vision has its scope, a shrapnel  
splash of filings chambered calm before the bang of Apple,  

Eye, and Ray: the bullet’s gaze honed down. Any line  
desires onely Everything; all squall & sprawl of motley time  

oblonging darkly for a single prize—symmetrically to shut  
up self in dim dimensioned squint—wanting to brush  

bright panoramas into sight’s corners, to hold them: embers  
lit without the lick of motive. Edges once limber end here;  

end, that is, wherever here is scribed. What’s actual is sketch;  
de-lineates itself: sight’s scrawl, a ghost of layered percepts.  

Our eyes want grasp & thus a shape; their lids, euclidean,  
zodiac the bric-a-brac of bodies, sing—O fit me in,  

empyrean, among your ferris-wheel of forms—dead center,  
null hub pronouncing its confines as cause & answer.  

Here are your parts, O hours, it indicates: a ramshackle Cast  
extracted from my side: this meadow-choir, Grass-shafts,  

a bending patch of cilia above/beneath the Hickory’s  
dendritic click. The mind as silt: black earth, black orrery—  

Stone sockets pocked at lonely intervals throughout, an  
interpolated blossom of reflections, foamy-crested Mountains  

tippling up to Moon, the logical cloud around us curled.  
Do we impose our visions on the world, or does the world  

reveal us, gradually, as clustered portions of its patterning?  
Either way, each seaming solid sight is fraught with yearning,  

graved in flaming, subtle lineaments. My self & other  
selves strung out, lined up, articulated like the sentence of  

a stuttering deity: “...I...I...I...I...,” serrated cry  
limned into type-cast characters that mar the music by  

omitting difference. No I is equal to another; each is  
formed and forms within its singular address, reaches  

through its buoyant cell-skin &, nourished, becomes  
alive again: volleyed between vacuum & continuum,  

guessing which is home. I balance dizzy on trajectories,  
alight on breezes, ever blind to what their vector is.  

In this same way, I bore into the day, its billion limbs &  
nodes: the host whose face I never wholly glimpse.
