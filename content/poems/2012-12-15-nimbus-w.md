What do you want with me?  
Why give me mind: welter of  
wings that beat each other  
weak with wanderlust?  

When I was young, I fashioned sprawling  
walls with Legos.  Nostalgia, meanwhile,  
wrapt me in its bounds.  I waited for the losses  
waiting would create.  

Why waken those wondrous  
worlds in me, only to wag Your finger  
warning: “Watch and wait”  
while hope wrings wrinkles in my face?  

What good’s my wondering now?  
<font size="2">WHERE  WHEN  WHO  HOW  WHY</font>  
<font size="2">WHAT</font>: a compass rose  
whithering at the window ledge.  

With my bow and my quiver I aim at You.  

Words, these words, are a wilderness of want  
where I am blown toward some vanishing point  
without ever arriving; where Your heady weather  
wields me, whittled whole.  

While dreams quake my scaffolding,  
worlds go on: snow thaws,  
weeds squeeze through, flowers hoist sweetness up  
without knowing how.  

We writhe in one another’s waves;  
whorled in their turbulence, cleansed.  The Question  
washed within the never of its quest.  The Answer  
widening its wake till waning  

water cannot bear its trace: wending on, inspired  
with wind the Question makes.
