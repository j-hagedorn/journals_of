*O Heavenly King, O Comforter,*  
*the Spirit of Truth, who is*  
*everywhere present & fills all*  
*things* — come & abide in us.  
  
Let these beloved dance  
into your garden kingdom—  
  
Let them be struck by a summer   
afternoon, go blueberry  
picking and forget about  
their calendars.  
  
May they know the peace  
that passes planning —  
  
Tomorrow, let each one's sleepy eyes  
open to see that vagrant  
they must become the home for.  
  
Let them be poor, and hungry, and tired  
Let them be as Christ to one another  
  
May each haul the other  
to the verge of themselves,  
and stare back long enough  
to become unfamiliar.  
  
Give them time to peel  
away their scabbed masks,  
to be raw in the presence.  
  
May they touch each others' wounds and not flinch.  
May they stand before each other with arms outstretched.  
  
Let each take up the other like a cross.  
  
Let them be overwhelmed with children,  
being childlike themselves,   
as even the old are new to their bewilderment.  
  
May the wild world humble them,  
harried, to each others’ arms.  
  
May each in the other find  
that curious journey whose  
endlessness is You—  
  
Be among them.   
Each day, fill the sea. Inspire the sky.  
Haunt them from behind each others’ eyes.  
  
*In the name of the Father, & of the Son, & of the Holy Spirit. Amen.*
