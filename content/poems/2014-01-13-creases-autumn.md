Novemberous, the body a warm sliver  
in frigid field, stark letter  
on page.  
  
Amid the panoplied  
cicatrice of branches, splay  
of angles swim in flame, in spectrum-  
petalled autumn: somewhere in  
there, the dirt is firm as death  
and resurrection, shared  
marginalia of earth & air, & we  
are scenery the gorgeous forest stares.  
  
Lean down & whisper histories  
in the upturned ears of flowers.  
Go in.  Tug up  
the scurf.  Lay theorems,  
accountings, poems  
there in the hungry nave.  
  
Aloft, gold flecks  
of light revolving float  
down & up, alight  
upon pond, unlock  
& lock  
    as tesserae, leaf’s toothy  
algorithmic edge, as form  
which is proportion which is always  
almost breaking  
  
as the great lake: its  
coruscant facets  
            etched everyhere  
  
St. Gregory describes us rising, sleuthing  
remnant atoms across  
the universe, the pulse of self still resonant  
  
Not atom but <font size="2">PERSON</font> is the fundamental thing.  
Not space but <font size="2">RELATION</font>.  
  
I want to be simple  
as sand,  
 as years between sands  
  
as pattern which is ratio which is word which is wilderness which is sacrifice which is love  
  
If the doors of perception were cleansed  
If the dark matter were swept away  
If 90% of the body’s cells are not human  
  
then what is it that prays in us?  
then stars would fill the spaceless sky  
then we would see things as they are.
