With our last polaroids we took pictures of <font size="2">LIGHT</font> and <font size="2">DARKNESS</font>  
  
Wild children ranged through the breezy doors  
  
Scenes wandered through us  
unfinished, smudged with cirrus  
moon hovered over sunred trees  
  
Most of matter is empty space.  
Most of what I know is ignorance.  

Dear one, you open in flickers.  
How can I keep you  
from closing up?  
from hardening  
around your guesses?  
  
A person doesn’t change  
except within boundaries  
as crystals sharpen in the dank dark  
as wildflowers crowd the trails edge  
  
A membrane is prerequisite for <font size="2">LIFE</font>.  
There has to be an inside and an out.  
What ratio of fear to reckless love?  
Strong but not brittle, open not spilling.  
How do we change without unravelling?  
  
Dear one, hold on—  
a little threadsong  
   to carry you  
through deep woods  
  
We are animals hunting for meanings, wearing  
the pelts of meanings.  

Nor is there singing school but studying:  
tibia,  fabula,  nebula  
  
vastuary  
  
All summer I have been reading you  
stories when I should have been teaching  
you silence  
  
using words made  
of beach stones  
  —the round  
tongues of eons  
  
All bloom long  
I should have been learning subtraction.  
  
It is natural to lie down.  
To pack my mouth full.  
  
O coax fruit from my lips, O blank O  
harbinger O time  
O darling girl  
I’m gonna hold you in my arms  
til your feet grow down
