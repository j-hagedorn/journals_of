*to Isaac, holding a scroll which reads:*  

Diligent apprentice of Reality, you rise  
tree by tree, exercise by exercise,  
not to master but to give  
homage to earth with earthen hands:  
entering while remaining still, becoming home.  

Never fastest of your child friends,  
your feet grew weighty even then.  
Patient in your roots, you suffered  
loneliness, estranged from those who spoke  
as kites with ease and air.  

To jettison oneself is not humility,  
you teach us, but to reach  
deeper than hurt into the firmament  

You delved until your fingers bled  
iron, and found a body lying  
coiled in the roots of justice,  
the crimson grove of mercy, seat  
of all who taste the sun.  

Perhaps the ground forgets our missteps. 

We want to think our failings  
by being hidden, are __ undone
as I want to believe that my failings have not harmed you

it is not so, but nevertheless
our machinations rust under wildflowers,
you face me again today with
resolute kindness

I ask only to be permitted to live with you a little longer

You, firstborn child, made our striving  
into a place

I am only beginning to understand, and never want to leave

I will knock down the gates of heaven if it means I can stay.


There is a garden in you.  
All the wandering elements drift in  
settle
you, unmovable soil of another world.  

Wolves roll and bare their bellies
for you
