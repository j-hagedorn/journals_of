*to Isaac, holding a scroll which reads:*  
*Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth*  

Diligent apprentice of Reality, you rise  
tree by tree, exercise by exercise,  
not to master but to give  
homage to earth with earthen hands:  
entering while remaining still, becoming home.  

Never fastest of your child friends,  
your feet grew weighty even then.  
Patient in your roots, you suffered  
loneliness, estranged from those who spoke  
as kites with ease and air.  

To jettison oneself, you teach us,  
is not humility.  Instead, to reach  
deeper than hurt into the firmament  

You delved until your fingers bled  
iron, deeper than justice into mercy.  

Perhaps the ground forgets our missteps.   
We want to think our failings  
by being hidden, are somehow undone.    

It is not so. And yet  
our machinations rust under wildflowers,  
and daily you greet my merest  
tries with resolute kindness, firm yielding,  
even forgiveness.  I only ask 

to dwell here still a space.  
You, firstborn child, made our striving  
into an actual place.  I awake,  
and I am still with you,  
only beginning to comprehend armies
bleeding over a patch of soil.

I will knock down the gates of heaven if it means I can stay.


There is a garden in you.  
All the wandering elements drift in  
settle
you, immovable soil of another world.  

Wolves roll and bare their bellies
to your hand

you number the beasts with mythic
accuracy: a thousand and one,  
ten-thousand, vermillion.

[literal and littoral]
