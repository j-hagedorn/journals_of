*to Isaac, holding a scroll which reads:*  
*Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth*  

Diligent apprentice of Reality, you rise  
tree by tree, exercise by exercise,  
not to master but to give  
homage to earth with earthen hands:  
entering while remaining still, becoming home.  

Never fastest of your child friends,  
your feet grew weighty even then.  
Patient in your roots, you suffered  
loneliness, estranged from those who spoke  
as kites with ease and air.  

To jettison oneself, you teach us,  
is not humility.  Instead, to reach  
deeper than hurt into the firmament  

You delved until your fingers bled  
iron, and found a body lying  
coiled in the roots of justice,  
the crimson grove of mercy, seat  
of all who taste the sun.  

Perhaps the ground forgets our missteps. 
We want to think our failings  
by being hidden, are somehow undone.    

It is not so. And yet  
our machinations rust under wildflowers,  
and you daily greet my merest  
tries with resolute kindness, firm yielding,  
even forgiveness.  I only ask 

to dwell here still a space.

You, firstborn child, made our striving  
into a place

the kind of dream of paradise which nations go to war to attain

I am only beginning to understand, and never want to leave

I will knock down the gates of heaven if it means I can stay.


There is a garden in you.  
All the wandering elements drift in  
settle
you, unmovable soil of another world.  

Wolves roll and bare their bellies
to your hand
