*to Isaac, holding a scroll which reads:*  
*Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth*  

Diligent apprentice of Reality, you rise  
tree by tree, exercise by exercise,  
not to master but to give  
homage to earth with earthen hands:  
entering while remaining still, becoming home.  

Never fastest of your child friends,  
your feet grew weighty even then.  
Patient in your roots, you suffered  
loneliness, estranged from those who spoke  
as kites with ease and air.  

To jettison oneself, you teach us,  
is not humility.  Instead, to reach  
deeper than hurt into the firmament  

You delved until your fingers bled  
iron, deeper than justice into mercy.  
Perhaps the ground forgets.  We wish  
our failings, being hidden, were undone.    

It is not so. And yet (*and yet!*)  
our machinations rust in wildflower patches,  
and daily you greet my merest  
tries with resolute kindness, firm yielding,  
even forgiveness.  I only ask 

to dwell here still a space.  
You, firstborn child, made our striving  
into an actual place.  I awake,  
and I am still with you  

beginning to fathom how the sacred  
places do not belong to us,  
even our blood in the ground.  

There is a garden in you.  
The wandering elements drift and float  
over a low wall, resting beside  
you, solid soil of other earths.  

The black wolf rolls and bares  
his famished belly to your hand.

Nurture verdure.  Go and number beasts  
with mythic accuracy: a thousand and one,  

ten-thousand, vermillion.  Mingle the fact  
with the truth.  Make us home.
