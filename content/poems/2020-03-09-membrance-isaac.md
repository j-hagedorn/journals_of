*to Isaac, holding a scroll which reads:*  

Diligent apprentice of Reality, you rise  
tree by tree, exercise by exercise,  
not to master but to give  
homage to earth with earthen hands:  
entering while remaining still, becoming home.  

Never fastest of your child friends,  
your feet grew weighty even then.  
Patient in your roots, you suffered  
loneliness, estranged from those who spoke  
as kites with ease and air.  

To jettison oneself is not humility,  
you teach us, but to reach  
deeper than hurt into the firmament  

You delved until your fingers bled  
iron, and found a body lying  
coiled in the roots of justice  
and crimson grove of mercy, seat  
of all who taste the sun.  

Perhaps the ground forgets our missteps.  

There is a garden in you.  
All the wandering elements settle in  

you, unmovable humus of another world.
