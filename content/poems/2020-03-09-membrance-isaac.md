*to Isaac, holding a scroll which reads:*  

Diligent apprentice of Reality, you rise  
tree by tree, exercise by exercise,  
not to master but to give  
homage to earth with hands autochthonous:  
entering while remaining still, becoming home.  

Never fastest of your child friends,  
your feet grew weighty even then.  
Patient in your roots, you suffered  
loneliness, estranged from those who spoke  
as kites with ease and air.  

To jettison oneself is not humility,  
you teach us, but to reach  
deeper than hurt into the firmament  

You delved (how deep is deep  
enough?) until your hands bled iron,  
until you found that justice ___  
is the ground of mercy, seat  
of those who taste the sun.  

Friend of beasts,
