Coordinates and lore,  
each view fruits  

awake to intersecting  
shafts of afternoon and wood.  

Each berrynode collects its  
small sphere full:  

attention sweetened  

from that pale, brittle  
soup the stirred leaves.  


A turquoise moss, coral  
antlers bob in slow  
mating rituals with the sun.  

I feel that way, warm  
approaching You--  

this bright, this  
playfull and this doomed.  


Arise my love, O petalled Yawn  
of infant green aflame.  

Arise O candle blade,  
grass ladder quivering taller  
over ground wet mouths.  


Desire the rising  
tongue and hungry  
insects grazing gazing  
down earth's dissolve,  

that dark inverted sun.  


Silence is the song  
the dead would  
raise for us, if they had  
not already spent  
their breath to call  
us here.  

Nowhere  
to step except  
through yearning things,  
infintimate.


Canopy twitches  
moths of light  
mirroring trillium.  

Hold on  
elm column, on  

earth as it is  
in the heavens.  

Amen among and in  
terraced mists  

with ferns alert as infant  
serpents.  

Good as we exist.  

We drink and taste  
the bottom of the sky.  


Who stands in  
instants understands.  

Now flowers no  
knowing when it ends.  

Is, and is  
a: to be, to be  

beside, between.  


Rehearse this subtle  
syllabary, lilt  
this weathered tempestry.  


Hold on and on,  

wind bent  
into your palms,  

unchangeless.
