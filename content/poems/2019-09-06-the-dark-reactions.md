I carry sleep within me 
like a lake,
just here,

to wash whatever is
too built, too inextricable, too
caught within the spell of logic

The scenes and numbers upward uncontrollably:
I have done wrong things, in wrong order, gone
asleep in the morning without waking

Shut eyes, I unmoor
the fossiled shore of sights,
palimpsest of shadow, veins of light

peridot,
rorshach forest,
port torches,
neon ferns,
cobalt of star charts,
lapis lazuli, the footstool 
of the heavens 
of the mind

Thrusting hands into ocean-cold dreams,  
all the fears come out like stones.

Round, the size of hands.
Already losing their color and roar.

Tears cleanse
skin's salted bed
with crystal

the inborn shape you thought to make
is gone, though you may still become
obedient to gravity and love

"think of your soul as knowing nothing" - St. Isaac, Fourth Discourse, 50.

unfasten the rungs
of reason once
you clamber
down or up
matters not

Nothing is the geometric dark
but shape
of contact 
with sheets

jagged, crinkled swerves
striations and dots

dark archipelago
inhabited perception
which loves contour
yet never knows

whether the edges
are adjacent to emptiness of fulnesse

(some greater watching)

whether my contours
are archipelagoes 
or lakes with growling banks

waterskin flat, ignorant of stars.

If I have a body, or thoughts, these are
projected from that 2D blotch - a hologram

---

No stars in the room, yet

pointillism of remembered, embered sight

which shows that all I ever see

is a miasmal wall

retina shimmered with reflections

Supine, the dome above
the rim my sight

is a sunken bowl,
inverted valley of my skull

You can walk through the same stream once
and when you do, it is the sky
