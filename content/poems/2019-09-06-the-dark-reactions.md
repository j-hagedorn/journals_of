I carry sleep in me.  
A lake, just here

beneath the eye:  
a vial of milk  

to wash whatever is  
too clean, too  
latched in sequence.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

A simple dark--  
Only the shapes  
of touch, outlined  

body to sheet.  
Knee, heel, cheek.  

Striations and dots:  
a blind map

flat as within  
the water's skin.  
Ignorant of stars.  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

I carry days in me.  
A buzzing pointillism:  

embers of remembered  
sights. All I have seen  

is a miasmal wall  
the retina retains:  

the constellated Dome  
reflected in 

a sunken bowl,  
caldera of the skull  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

Into ocean-cold  
dreams, reach:  

each fear or lust  
emerges like a stone.  

Hand-sized, having lost  
color and roar.  

The inborn shape  
you thought to make  

is gone, though you  
may still become  

obedient  
to gravity and love  

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

You can walk through the same stream once  
and when you do, it is the sky

⁕  ⁕  ⁕  

*Think of your soul*  
*as knowing nothing*  
says St. Isaac.  

Press your palms  
against your eyes.  

Fossils of light  
embossed in us.

Abseil there  
through peridot,  

a rorshach forest  
of tesselated ferns,  

ascend cobalt star charts:  
*Lapis lazuli*, footstool  

of the heavens  
of the mind.  

Unfasten the rungs  
of reason once  
you clamber 

down or up  
matters not.
