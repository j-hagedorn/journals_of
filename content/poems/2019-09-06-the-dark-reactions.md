I carry sleep in me.  
A lake, just here,  

to wash what's too clean,  
too latched in sequence.  

---

Nothing is in  
the simple dark  
but shapes
of contact, body-against-sheet:

jagged, crinkled swerves
striations and dots

dark archipelago
inhabited perception
which loves contour
yet never enters

adjacent, meaning to throw
symbol, meaning

whether the edges
are adjacent to emptiness of fulnesse

(some greater watching)

whether my contours
are archipelagoes 
or lakes with growling banks

waterskin flat, ignorant of stars.

No stars in the room, yet

pointillism of remembered, embered sight

which shows that all I ever see

is a miasmal wall

retina shimmered with reflections

Supine, the dome above
the rim my sight

is a sunken bowl,
inverted valley of my skull

You can walk through the same stream once
and when you do, it is the sky

Shut eyes, I unmoor
the fossiled shore of sights,
palimpsest of shadow, veins of light

peridot,
rorshach forest,
port torches,
neon ferns,
cobalt of star charts,
lapis lazuli, the footstool 
of the heavens 
of the mind

Thrust a hand into ocean-cold dreams,  

Each fears emerges like a stone.

Round, hand-sized, having lost  
already its color and roar.

Tears cleanse
skin's salted bed
with crystal

the inborn shape you thought to make
is gone, though you may still become
obedient to gravity and love

"think of your soul as knowing nothing" - St. Isaac, Fourth Discourse, 50.

unfasten the rungs
of reason once
you clamber
down or up
matters not
