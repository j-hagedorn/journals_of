I carry sleep in me.  
A lake, just here

beneath the eye:  
a vial of milk  

to wash what's too clean,  
too latched in sequence.  

---

A simple dark.  
Only the shapes  
of touch, body-to-sheet.

Knee, heel, cheek,  

striations and dots:  
a blind map

flat as within  
the water's skin,  
as ignorant of stars.  

---

I carry day in me.  
A buzzing pointillism:  

embers of remembered  
sights. All I have seen  

is a miasmal wall,  
the retina retains:  

the constellated dome  
a sunken bowl,
inverted caldera of my skull.

Lights embossed upon us.

You can walk through the same stream once
and when you do, it is the sky

---

Unmoor the fossiled  
shore of sights,
palimpsest of shadow, veins of light

peridot, rorshach forest,
cobalt of star charts,
neon ferns, port torches,
lapis lazuli, footstool 
of the heavens 
of the mind

Into ocean-cold dreams, reach:  

Each fear emerges like a stone.

Round, hand-sized, having lost  
already its color and roar.

Tears cleanse
skin's salted bed
with crystal

The inborn shape  
you thought to make

is gone, though you 
may still become

obedient to gravity and love

---

"think of your soul as knowing nothing" - St. Isaac, Fourth Discourse, 50.

unfasten the rungs
of reason once
you clamber
down or up
matters not

---

adjacent, meaning to throw
symbol, meaning to throw

whether the edges
are adjacent to emptiness of fulnesse

(some greater watching)

whether my contours
are archipelagoes 
or lakes with growling banks
