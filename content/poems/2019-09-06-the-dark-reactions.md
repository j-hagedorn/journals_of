I carry sleep in me.  
A lake, just here

beneath the eye:  
a vial of milk  

to wash what's too clean,  
too latched in sequence.  

---

A simple dark.  
Only the shapes  
of touch, body-to-sheet.

Knee, heel...

striations and dots:  
a blind map

of perception which loves  
contour yet never enters

---

adjacent, meaning to throw
symbol, meaning to throw

whether the edges
are adjacent to emptiness of fulnesse

(some greater watching)

whether my contours
are archipelagoes 
or lakes with growling banks

waterskin flat, ignorant of stars.

---

No stars in the room, yet

pointillism of an embered sight

which shows that all I ever see

is a miasmal wall

retina shimmered with reflections

The dome above my gazing
is a sunken bowl,
inverted valley of a skull

You can walk through the same stream once
and when you do, it is the sky

---

Unmoor the fossiled  
shore of sights,
palimpsest of shadow, veins of light

peridot, rorshach forest,
cobalt of star charts,
neon ferns, port torches,
lapis lazuli, footstool 
of the heavens 
of the mind

Thrust a hand into ocean-cold dreams,  

Each fear emerges like a stone.

Round, hand-sized, having lost  
already its color and roar.

Tears cleanse
skin's salted bed
with crystal

The inborn shape  
you thought to make

is gone, though you 
may still become

obedient to gravity and love

---

"think of your soul as knowing nothing" - St. Isaac, Fourth Discourse, 50.

unfasten the rungs
of reason once
you clamber
down or up
matters not
