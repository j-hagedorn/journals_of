Asleep this afternoon.  Between cool sheets,  
my warmer shadow.  Against its solid edges  
muscle coils and extends in secret,  

veins meander, gathering blue  
and serpentine descend, continue inward to  
the crescent center of my need.  

Press your finger into me and I will bloom.  
A bruise is a rose grown toward the sense  
of elsewhere shining past my ends.

Yet I depend on these boundaries, coherence  
of a form imbued with essence and defined:  
the line about each thing marking its presence.  

<font size="2">
UP CLOSE THE SKIN IS FRAUGHT WITH PASSAGES.  
OUR CHILDREN WRESTLED THROUGH ME & REMAIN & I  
INVITE YOU LAMPLIT, SILVERY AGAIN TO COME:  
PRESS YOUR CHEEK AGAINST THE GROUND: THE LEVEL WALL  
OF EARTH ANOTHER SKIN WE ENTER  
</font>

What will be left of 'us', divided up into  
those mulching stars apart?  What un-hand tends  
the loom of mute facts, ever generating?  

I need it to be human, to remember  
us, because even more than to control  
I want to be known.  Within these hollows,  

through sensual labyrinths we speed  
inattentive, which is deathward, pursued  
between the level bleak where feeling blends.  

Limits focus.  What few touches I've devoted  
let me attend entire, kissing  
together our divided smiles, let me continue  

breathing incense from our childrens' hair, preserve  
the space through which I reach toward embrace.  
Without this distance, where else would I honor?  

<font size="2">
IS THAT WHY YOU STILL TRY TO KEEP  
YOURSELF IN DIAMOND DISTANCE, ABLE TO REFLECT  
BUT NOT TO BURN?  

ONLY ACROSS THE FEVER-BORDERED FLESH  
WE LONG, REACH, SAMPLE, MIX & MAKE, BECOME.  
YOU'RE NOT ENOUGH.  
</font>

My fingers end where yours begin: a loop  
that spans our whole divided life.  Whatever drew  
your arms to vine my shoulders, brought me to  

be this broken, punctuated man: with all the elements,  
and growling wind, and lizards flickering through  
its walls.  With holes where lights & rain spill in.  

If we'll select our remade bodies then,  
wherever this biology extends,  
I want to share with you: enlarge  

this single cell to be all entrance,  
greeting you  
ever again, again  

coming to and going  
<font size="2">TOUCHING OUR SKIN</font>, delighted  
<font size="2">TO FIND</font> you in.
