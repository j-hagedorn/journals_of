Asleep this afternoon.  Between cool sheets,  
my warmer shadow.  Against its solid edges  
muscle coils and extends in secret,  

veins meander, gathering blue  
and serpentine descend, continue inward to  
the crescent center of my need.  

Press your finger into me and I will bloom.  
A bruise, a rose grown toward the sense  
of elsewhere shining past my ends.

Yet I depend on boundaries, coherence  
of a form imbued with essence and defined:  
the line about each thing marking its presence.
