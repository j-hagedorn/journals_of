Asleep this afternoon.  Between cool sheets,  
my warmer shadow.  Against its solid edges  
muscle coils and extends in secret,  

veins meander, gathering blue  
and serpentine descend, continue inward to  
the crescent center of my need.  

Press your finger into me and I will bloom.  
A bruise is a rose grown toward the sense  
of elsewhere shining past my ends.

Yet I depend on these boundaries, coherence  
of a form imbued with essence and defined:  
the line about each thing marking its presence.  

<font size="2">
UP CLOSE THE SKIN IS FRAUGHT WITH PASSAGES.  
OUR CHILDREN WRESTLED THROUGH ME & REMAIN & I  
INVITE YOU LAMPLIT, SILVERY AGAIN TO COME:  
PRESS YOUR CHEEK AGAINST THE GROUND: THE LEVEL WALL  
OF EARTH ANOTHER SKIN WE ENTER  
</font>

What will be left of 'us', divided up into  
the mulching stars apart?  What un-hand tends  
the loom of mute facts, generating?  

I need it to be human, to remember  
us, because even more than to control  
I want to be known, within these hollows.
