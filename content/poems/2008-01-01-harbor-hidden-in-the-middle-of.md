*Harbor hidden in the middle of*  
*a turbid current: sperm-tails flailing*  
*radiant around a naked solus, ovum*  
*beckoning its spent rays in.  Each*  
*oval head (a match, a latent smoke of info)*  
*rubs its cheek against the stony fruit…*  

How does a life expand to meet capacity?  
*I* splitting into *Y*s, diffuse, confused,  
does one become, at last, a parody of self,  
diminished twig clung stubborn to the branch’s  
end?  or spread alive at once across its years, a  
net of nerve to seize the wind in alleluia?  

Impelled to fill one pattern once we start, the others,  
never touched, lie fallow with imaginary crops—  

Two trees grew separate in a garden once, but  
how to tell the difference now? What life can we conceive  
except the one we know, crooked with leaving?  

Myopia, my opus: a cross-eyed squint  
in radiating focus, half-divining vision.  
*Deus absconditus*—draw in the periphery, grant me  
direct sight, or at least a wending  
life in which the distances are knit.  
Even this flimsy string of time should be enough.  

*One matchhead breaks the skin and then, slow*  
*flame, the vast potentials end, begin.*
