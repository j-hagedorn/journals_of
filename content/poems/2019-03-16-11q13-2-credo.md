To be clear.  I'm not sure how  
belief is different than hypothesis,  
except it weighs me in the balance.  

JUST GO.  And what if I leave  
some out?  YOU WILL.  Okay then, I believe:  

The hidden green wings of the orange tree.  

Solace and urge of camouflage.  The seed-  
clouds wrung in gold from cypress, palsied  

from ache of spring.  TO BE  
IS FURTHER THAN TO THINK.  I know, and cleave  

to thoughts which harness our perceived  
edifice of earth to drift and dream.   

With words, within words, I believe  
in human gestures tangling soil and breeze,  
possessed by distance:  BREATHE,  

& STAND INTO THE GROUND.  
I FOLLOW THE WEARING LIPS  

OF MARBLE STEPS: PEOPLE & ALL  
THEIR DESTINATIONS EVEN  

MY ERRANT OWN:  that gravity  
cables my ligaments  
under the molten floor and then  

between the charted stars -- the howl  
of meadow and shadow is among me  

as a shallow hole, a grail, a sea of  
wings rippling.  JUST NEVER LEAVE.  

If hell's X marks the midst of me, if  
beauty's greedy tendril weaves  
me earthward, if FAITH IS WEIGHT AND I BELIEVE  

ON THE NARROW BED OF YOUR BODY  
IN ALL THINGS VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE  

A RAFT
