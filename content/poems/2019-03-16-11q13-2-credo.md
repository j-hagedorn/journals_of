To be clear.  I'm not sure how  
belief is different than hypothesis,  
except it weighs me in the balance.  

<font size="2">JUST GO.</font>  And what if I leave  
some out?  <font size="2">YOU WILL.</font>  Okay then, I believe:  

The hidden green wings of the orange tree.  

Solace and urge of camouflage.  The seed-  
clouds wrung in gold from cypress, palsied  

ache of spring.  <font size="2">TO BE  
IS FURTHER THAN TO THINK.</font>  I know, I cleave  

to thoughts which harness the perceived  
edifice of dust to drift and dream.   

With words.  In words.  I believe  
these gestures tangling soil and breeze,  
possessed by distance:  <font size="2">BREATHE,  

& STAND INTO THE GROUND.  
FOLLOW THE WEARING LIPS  

OF MARBLE STEPS: PEOPLE & ALL  
THEIR DESTINATIONS EVEN  

MY ERRANT OWN</font>: that gravity  
cables my ligaments  
under molten floor and then  

unto the charted stars -- the howl  
of meadow and shadow is among me  

a shallow hole, a grail, a sea of  
wings rising, rinsing.  <font size="2">YOU CAN'T CONCEIVE.</font>  

If hell's *X* marks the midst of me, if  
beauty's greedy tendril weaves  
me earthward, if... <font size="2">FAITH IS WEIGHT: I BELIEVE  

ON THE NARROW BED OF YOUR BODY  
IN ALL THINGS VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE  
</font>

In the compounding and immense  
space that ferments  
between what we say and all  

we mean to mean: may we breathe  
subtle air within that great naïveté  

and never draw the *O* complete  
and leave the open cove my mouth  

echoless aside the unclenched winds  
--orisons without end.  To balance  
someplace vaster than my feet  

will go, and to receive  
whatever narrow frequencies  
the Bright Margins will tender me  

with open ochre palms, and never leave.
