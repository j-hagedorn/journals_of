To be clear.  I'm not sure how  
belief is different than hypothesis,  
except it weighs me in the balance.  

<font size="2">JUST GO.</font>  And what if I leave  
some out?  <font size="2">YOU WILL.</font>  Okay then, I believe:  

The hidden green wings of the orange tree.  

Solace and urge of camouflage.  The seed-  
clouds wrung in gold from cypress, palsied  

from ache of spring.  <font size="2">TO BE  
IS FURTHER THAN TO THINK.</font>  I know, I cleave  

to thoughts which harness this perceived  
edifice of earth to drift and dream.   

With words, in words: I believe  
these gestures tangling soil and breeze,  
possessed by distance:  <font size="2">BREATHE,  

& STAND INTO THE GROUND.  
FOLLOW THE WEARING LIPS  

OF MARBLE STEPS: PEOPLE & ALL  
THEIR DESTINATIONS EVEN  

MY ERRANT OWN</font>: that gravity  
cables my ligaments  
under the molten floor and then  

between the charted stars -- the howl  
of meadow and shadow is among me  

a shallow hole, grail-sea of  
wings rippling.  <font size="2">YOU CAN'T CONCEIVE.</font>  

If hell's *X* marks the midst of me, if  
beauty's greedy tendril weaves  
me earthward, if... <font size="2">FAITH IS WEIGHT: I BELIEVE  

ON THE NARROW BED OF YOUR BODY  
IN ALL THINGS VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE  
</font>

In the compounding and immense  
space that ferments  
between what we say and all  

we mean to mean: may we breathe  
the subtle air within that great naïveté.
