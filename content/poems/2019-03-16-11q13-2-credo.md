To be clear.  I'm not sure how  
belief is different than hypothesis,  
except it weighs me in the balance.  

JUST GO.  And what if I leave  
some out? YOU WILL.  Okay then, I believe:  

The hidden green wings of the orange tree.  

Solace and urge of camouflage.  The seed-  
clouds wrung in gold from a cypress, palsied  

from want of spring.  YOU KNOW, TO BE  
IS FURTHER THAN TO THINK.  But yet I cleave  

to thoughts which harness our perceived  
edifice of earth to drift and dream.   

With words, within words, I believe  
in human gestures tangling soil and breeze,  
possessed by distance.  BREATHE,  

& STAND INTO THE GROUND.  
I FOLLOW THE WORN LIPS  

OF MARBLE STEPS, PEOPLE & ALL  
THEIR WEAVING DESTINATIONS

(EVEN MY ERRANT OWN)
