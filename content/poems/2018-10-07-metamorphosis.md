Under the moon, the meadow screams.
Skunk pungent, poignant, sick smell of the core of something.
The crickets raise their million legs, and rain falls again and again from leaf to leaf. A prolonged, punctuated storm.

Oils from fingers will seep into 
mothwings, making it unable to rudder the great winds precisely. 

From darkest cloisters of a monastic library, a devious God has unleashed the Scriptures of the miniaturists.

like animals bred with plants, milkweed unleashes small aerial sheep across the plains.  
They stink if one gets stuck in your nose. 
And who will shepherd them to scatter on the slopes of wind.  When they die, stalks rise from their corpses.

The ground sprouts lambs-ear, green fur. 
It is practicing the making of skins, to unlatch from the earth and run, lambs ear and her flesh draped over driftwood ribs.  with eyes they will make from the daisies, from the black eyed Susan‘s, which I walk daily curiously past.

They will use a cactus for it asshole, and what would eat. Grass, still grass is the ferment. It must stay.

Or they will eat the sun. Galloping, and eating the mornings. At dusk, settling down In a patch of their ancestors. That’s how believable stories about the from the earth.  The wind scouring their roots and knuckles clean, clean of food and of dependence for the moment.

The first few winters were the hardest. Without a place to rest, clawing at the door of birth, I came to me that back they die in the cold with their seeds inside of them.

The entire Meadow, planes, landscape: held together by a net of grass roots. If these fail, lakes will drop away, tree lines crumble into earths mouth. Or worse: shopping malls will rise up through the gap’s.
