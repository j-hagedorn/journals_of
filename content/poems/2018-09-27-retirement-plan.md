*for Nadia*

Bones creaking, I will move  
into the house you drew for me.

We will swim through books  
whose words are waves of a sea.  
wvwvvwvwvwwvwvwvvw

Under the roof like a letter *A*  
a storm of small feet echoing in  
the ceiling  

Your face a bright, erratic round  
of hope exceeding details,  
starker than.  

My eyes all pupil, smile  
eking past my cheeks.
