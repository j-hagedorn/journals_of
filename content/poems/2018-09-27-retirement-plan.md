*for Nadia*

Bones creaking, I will move  
into the house you drew for me.

We'll swim through books  
whose words are a scrawling sea.  

Beneath that roof like a letter *A*,  
a storm of small feet on the ceiling.  

Your face a bright, erratic round  
of hope exceeding details, starker than.  

My eyes all pupil, smile  
eking past my cheeks.
