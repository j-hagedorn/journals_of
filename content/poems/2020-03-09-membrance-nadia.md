*to Dezh, holding a scroll which reads:*  
*I am poured out like water*  


More beautiful because you don't suspect,  
You search our lively world and let  
your rainbow face alight in cornices  
of each emotion: goofball, tristessa, principessa.  

St. Gregory says whatever subtle shades  
and shapes God takes, becoming human,  
are illumined.  And he embraces all.  

The river in its infinite shifts  
makes every face, each fleeting crease.  

Sole girl within this raucous house  
you trace a lilting line between  
solitary and social, one and many.  

You circulate, you weave the rooms  
and all of us together with  
your song.  A river whispering nourishment  

as one performs the consequential act  
for which she came to earth.  

You sit beneath the birch conversing  
with wistful joy for the imagined  
world in the midst of making.  

Dreams pace the shores, our days.  

In any lovely thing we make,  
we accept constraints  
and what we make is lovelier,  
brimming with love, for having strained.  

The river would not be infinite  
without its banks.  Bounding beyond,  

you overflow your narrow bones  
curling like fire, colored with sky.
