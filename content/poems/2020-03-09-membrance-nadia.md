*to Dezh, holding a scroll which reads:*

More beautiful because you don't suspect  
and search our lively world and let  
your rainbow face alight the cornices  
of each emotion.  Goofball.  Tristessa. Principessa.  
Doctor Who?  

...  

St. Gregory says whatever subtle shades  
our God did not take into Himself,  
becoming human, would not be illumined.  
And so he embraced it all.
