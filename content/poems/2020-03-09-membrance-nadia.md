*to Dezh, holding a scroll which reads:*  
*I am poured out like water*  


...

More beautiful because you don't suspect,  
You search our lively world and let  
your rainbow face alight in cornices  
of each emotion.  Goofball.  Tristessa. Principessa.  
Doctor Who?  

...  

St. Gregory says whatever subtle shades  
God did not take into Himself,  
becoming human, would not be illumined.  
And so he embraced it all.  

...

Only girl within this raucous house
you wander solitary through the rooms

wistful, almost absent-minded
as one performs the consequential act
for which they came to earth

you weave the rooms and us together with your songs
a river whispering, nourishment



...  

In any lovely thing we make,
we accept constraints
and what we make is lovelier
for having strained

The river would not be infinite  
without its banks.
