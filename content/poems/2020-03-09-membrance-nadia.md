*to Dezh, holding a scroll which reads:*  
*I am poured out like water*  


More beautiful because you don't suspect,  
You search our lively world and let  
your rainbow face alight in cornices  
of each emotion: goofball, tristessa, principessa.  

St. Gregory says whatever subtle shades  
and shapes God takes, becoming human,  
are illumined.  And he embraces all.  

The river in its infinite shifts  
makes every face.

...

Sole girl within this raucous house  
you circulate, tracing a lilting line  
between solitary and social, one:many

With wistful joy for the imagined  
world in the midst of making

you weave the rooms and us together with  
your song, a river whispering nourishment

as one performs the consequential act
for which she came to earth

...

as dreams pace the shores of our days

...  

In any lovely thing we make,
we accept constraints
and what we make is lovelier
for having strained

The river would not be infinite  
without its banks.


...
