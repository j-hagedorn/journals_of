*to Dezh, holding a scroll which reads:*  
*I am poured out like water*  

...

More beautiful because you don't suspect,  
You search our lively world and let  
your rainbow face alight in cornices  
of each emotion.  Goofball.  Tristessa. Principessa.

God did not take into Himself,  
becoming human, would not be illumined.  
And so he embraced it all.
