If we would linger long within this land  
we must permit our wings to petrify,  

must take a river for a gullet
our antique sunken names among the barges.

For we are young as morning's  
washings onto shore.

We must become fretted
with arches, traversed by sky

and breasts, so many,  
quarried from depths, alert as birds

and valves to bring and bear away
those who travel through us

moss-crotched, patient in want, you perch above a bowl of holy water  
Egyptian eyebrows, Baroque skin, a travertine skull

you must keep, just off center, your heart

a wound: an altar  

a valved instrument 
to lure and bear away

through cavernous gates
conveying centuries of travelers  
reborn to tunnels, lungs and dawns  


here they paint houses with the sun's revelations:  
rust petal, blood-orange,  

and tourists take pictures by the bleaching hour  
sharing the colors of until.

the city is eternal because you are not
you are a portion of its eternity

shout to tilt the song
to anthem on the lips
of flower-sellers, washing tomorrow's pavement
