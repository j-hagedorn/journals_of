*to Ezra, holding a scroll which reads:*  


You sensed that meaning was aligned  
to love, and searched our smiles  
farther than your own.  From there,  
acutest pivot of the heart, you  
crafted a slapstick judo, poking our  
ponderous thoughts until they tumbled clean.  

Raised among ancient bustle, you sought  
the crisp, the minimalist.  Now hone  
yourself toward the 'one thing needful'.  

Princely, aloof, as when you strode  
with red umbrella by the Coliseum,  
may your thoughts be light enough  
to leap even your own image.  

Your life is in your brother,  
obverse twin.  It is your tenderness,  
and not your craft, that marks you.  
A vulnerable grin you sometimes shine,  
galloping with children on your back.  

You will allow the various world  
to meet in your soul's cove,  
that nexus of ___ and ___  
which image or alphabet cannot inscribe.  

When time is full Reality will place  
into your palm a pure stone    
lapped in tidal syllables,  
a truer name.  Until then, hold  
the space that stone will occupy.  

Others will gather there
