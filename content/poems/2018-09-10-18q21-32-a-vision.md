It is because I occupy  
this spot and not those ribbed  
beyond blood's bounds, the bright lip  

of my eyes and their admissions,  
giving and taking in curious elisions:  
shadows' blur and carvature. A mind divides  

touch from distance, cinches  
these with datastrings, a stippled ribbon  
too thin to gather what it's given.  

It is to ladle stars out of the tide,  
out of the squinted evening sifting,  
that I've waited to receive a Vision,  

i.e. be hijacked by another's sight, dipped  
in twisted vistas where a sun robed purple  
heaves shadows blaring up through the cracks.  

But daily to feel your eyes instead imbibe  
my face, a matter of fact, mere blip  
smiled by among abrupt the hectic cycles;  

to age and shrink among your thoughts hubbub  
the only visions these revolving blurbs  
bulleted gasps I try to occupy...  
                                                      
Sight fills us only if we're cut in half, trapped  
as one raw petal in the thicket-barbs  
of perspectives pinning each occurrence,  
                                                      
each moment's *me*, small as it is  
and infinite as it receives.  
My ringed life lit beyond the band of sight.  
                                                      
What slender we nab from the High Dimensions  
unhasps bearing their insignias.  
If we talk in kitchens peeling clementines  
                                                      
or walk into the jackpines scabbed with sap,  
we gain dimension tracing ghosts, palpable  
yet, delicate tread of moons across our ebbing  

calendars.  Color by line, we absorb  
radiance at seams, where absence & light oppose  
to form what gracious shapes our eyes can catch  
                            
and fuse into the act itself of sight:  
horizon's haloed razor, the sea-veins rising,  
and your face.  Your face, which love incises  
  
glaring back within my own: iconic  
and quizzical; sour, slaphappy,  
balancing hell with casual aplomb.  

To you again this splintered I unites, beside.  
To see together is to make revisions  
                              surprising  
                              
Knowing you needs be nimble, arcing a divide  
from focus to forget.  Remember me when I go missing,  
keep the lines lively as you draw me in, in prisms.  

And if all directions can converge on each blip  
of gridded space, and each blip seek and probe  
in all directions, rippling out cyclic,  

we are reliquaries of everything, supple  
of sense to counterpoise, not oppose,  
a flowering asterisk, a choice[...]
