  The bedroom window was a slab   
  of night, a small boy kneeling inside.  
  
  Bid by my dad to conjure you, Infinity,  
  I guessed our talk would be   
  
  a volley of perspectives,  
  transacted in English.  
  
  *Dear Heavenly Father*... and  
  
  then silent years compiled in me to recognize  
  that silent eons could be your reply.  
  
  Dear lush void —  
  Dear fire slow and cold as peridot —  
  Dear skyless forest steeped in fresh light —  
  
  You palimpsest of all perspectives,  
  touch tethering each atom-crumb to balance  
  
  me with folded fingers, there, here, ever,   
  at the trembling equipoise of stars.

  Without a medium there can be no sound.  
  
  If there is air, we touch, even across silence.   
  
  Sound is caress across distance,  
  as *converse* means both opposite & speak.  
  
  Vibration derives from tension, longing   
  to be there over here: me within you,  
  
  a music invoked from opposites.  
  
  Humming in the listening air, I've never been alone   
  but numb.  
  
  How long until I join the song I'm from?

  Dissolving and resolving,  
  
  our songs become magma-thrum   
  or glide aloft the ghostly clef of bats.  
  
  Here in the Great Lakes State,   
  I am reading about dolphins  
  
  whose chantings carry back the forms   
  hidden in squid: a shell-beak, a sac of ink.  
  
  Deaf to those registers, I probe the cornices of mine,  
  rolling sounds around my mouth.

  I bow and greet  
  the moss-blessed rock—   
  
  Does my voice bear   
  the feel of grit and velvet back to me?  
  
  Like dolphins' essence-hauling songs,   
  our words burr and snag   
  
  on certain facets of Reality: [blame](https://doi.org/10.3758/pbr.17.5.644) or [hope](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0132145)   
  
  A dictionary’s billion incantations skim   
  something from the brilliant deep.  
  
  Something of us, scattered there.

  A sweet patina of cliché, of others' usage,  
  covers my tongue, this public thing:  
  
  a daily language, a communal sense   
  which Cicero calls the ground of oratory.   
  
  A vast wind is partitioned among our lungs,  
  into mild greetings.  
  
  Not oracular, the breeze twitches   
  a leaf in the thicket,  
  
  while robins' calls embellish the air  
  with little syllables: Hello. Hello.

  Each thrush’s curlicue of song is woven of neurons,  
  a bird-brain stretched across the canopy.  
  
  “*Our conversation is in the heavens*”, writes St. Paul.  
  We live in the unfolding minds of others.  
  
  In a few paces, the forest thins into meadow, indefinite   
  as the penumbra of the self.  
  
  The shape of the grasses matches  
  the shimmering wind, the tide-combed clouds.  
  
  “*Let there be commerce between us.*”

  Image of God. Echo chamber of God.  
  
  Prayer in the caverned mouth,  
  that little vestibule of sky.  
  
  Words abide there,  
  hermetic, seeking illumination.  
  
  The cypress in the mind. The inflorescent   
  meristem, the mind.  
  
  Brother Birch, Mother Maple, you feel  
  how light wrings our voluble thanks.

  Tar-lunged, char-lunged, now I harbor  
  less of the sky in me.  
  
  The ache in my sternum, oil-beetle-black,  
  seed of a dark fruit  
  
  is a pact I have made with earth,  
  with growing death — through death,  
  
  rather, having trusted distance less  
  than contact.
