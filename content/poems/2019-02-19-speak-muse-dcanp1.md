Under all form, an entry to the thrum  
of song beneath the eyes, the ground:  

Come. Home. Follow the seam  
of your wound outward beyond its entry.  

Echo back along the chord which  
plucks us from silence into embryo.  

How do we sound distinctly anyway?  
Only because the under-hum is touched.  

Empty, it trembles out a bell, a self,  
that lonely tone broken oddly away.  

Rounded, honed, my verses speak into  
their own ears, recount their breaths,  

post clouds around their doubts;  
a cyclone combed & calmed until it's done.  

Come on.  I need you to respond,  
resound, slip sentences between my own.  

WHAT WD YOU DO WITHOUT ME?  Entropy,  
probably.  IT WAS RHETORICAL.
