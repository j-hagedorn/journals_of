*to Soren, holding a scroll which reads:*  
*It is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire*  

You want to be known yet  
even you cannot secure the clouds  
revolving in you, the dizzy pendulum  
of light and dark and inbetween.

Wary connoisseur of pain and flavor:  
Beauty wounds, you apprehend in it  
the nearest tip of an immensity  
which will sever you from yourself.  

...  

Tempered: as anger flaring from rigidity  
yet also in that other sense  
of durant strength obtained through flame.  

Severe and yet you are undone  
by any person's tears.  You taste  
in them a river coursing from  
some vast interior like your own.  
And you are not alone.  

Leaning back against the wall, beside  
this Holy Altar, Nikes peeking out  
from robes of geometric gold:  There,  

between storms of magma and  
the coldest meteors above, Reality  
(He of light and seeming darkness)  
draws you, infinite and intimate.  

Fire and crystal fuse your soul,  
a salt bloom which coaxes  
savour into all it touches.  

In a world numb with measure,  
yours will be the dancing shades,  
taste of pomegranite, its mineral skin,

the crook in the divining rod  
pointing to water by its brokenness.
