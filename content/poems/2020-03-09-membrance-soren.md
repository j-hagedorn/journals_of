*to Soren, holding a scroll which reads:*  

You want to be known yet  
even you cannot secure the clouds  
revolving in you, the dizzy pendulum  
of light and dark and inbetween

Wary connoisseur of pain and flavor:  
Beauty wounds, you apprehend in it  
the nearest tip of an immensity  
which will undo you ___  ___

...  

Tempered: as anger flaring from rigidity  
yet also in that other sense
of durant strength obtained through fire

Severe and yet you are undone  
by any person's tears.  You taste  
in them a river coursing from  
some vast interior like your own.  
And you are not alone.  

Leaning there against the wall beside  
this Holy Altar, Nikes peeking out  
from robes of geometric gold.  There,  
middled between storms of magma and  
the coldest meteors above, our God  
(He of light and seeming darkness)  
draws near you, infinite and intimate.  

Fire and crystal fuse your soul,  
a salt which coaxes  
savour out of all it touches.  

In a world numb with measure,  
yours will be the tangled shadings,  
taste of ___ and ____ ___

the crook in the divining rod  
pointing to water by its brokenness.
