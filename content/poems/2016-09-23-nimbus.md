My soul has leeched into my skin.  
Raw, haunted.  Prayers are like this, a cloud  
of breath on an icon's varnish.  

On a good day, my thoughts rest  
on the grass like the shadows of grass,  
blade by blade by blade.  

I am trying to understand — in  
the most basic sense: to be beneath, perhaps,  
or even to be with  

To run a hand along the branching  
walls of ancient cities  
as a way to know that I am  

To mouth, like wind across  
doorways, each voluble syllable  

Not to be bewitched by thoughts  

To handle stones: earth’s braille  
that scrapes my fingerprints,  
swallows touch into rough sense  

In an image blacked by candle  
smoke, You press one finger  
to another finger.  

Some nights the child me would pinch  
another smaller me, another room,  
and so on: symbols pressed breathless.  

The storied worlds have looked their sights  
away.  The only faith I try—  

Finger, pointing to  
finger, pointing.  

Pinch of something touching back.  

Bless this.
