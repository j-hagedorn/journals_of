I come to pass.  

What have I to do  
with the fulness of time?  

Ever seeing but never  
perceiving the old paths of  
the seas, oil of gladness.  

There shall be and there was  
and all that.  

Return and lie down, moon,  
to the cave, to the house.  

To the prayer, come soon.  
If you touch the socket, I will  
teach you the fear.

Your words increase and  
multiply and fill my mouth  

with swarms of living.  

I go down to be  
called by a new name  
according to the voice  

of the sun in  
the wilderness:  

"*Your hand in the book  
and the oak leviathan  
are one flesh*."
