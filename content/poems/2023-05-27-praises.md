1.  

Yawn how fascinated  
we are with  
ourselves: incurved animal.  

I hope you are not so, though  
those adjectives we send you  
(*almighty*, *all-knowing*) hint otherwise.  

I hope you are curious  

that your attention flows  
beyond the infinite, beyond us.  

---
    
2.  
  
We send our trash into space:  
a form of the prayer we've made  
as long as we could speak.  

I move things from one  
place to another, and when I am done  
I move my desires.  

I want to be spoken to,  
and everyone speaks to you, and so  

I must become  
that certain sort of nothing.  

---

3.

Few eyes have I stared  
into, precarious:  

Are they, are you, not shy of being seen  
but of destroying me?  

---

4.

Ultraviolet, infrared:  
Those registers of light and sound  
surrounding us,  
deserted of human perception.  

Whatever I call you fits  
into the narrowing band  
of my attention.  

Relief to recognize  
there are infinities immediately  
past my touch.  

---

5.

You have always been  
a figure for my ignorance,  
invisible yet existing.  

"Reality", St. Isaak says.  

And I have never needed  
to see a thing  
to harm it: quite the opposite,  

I deaden feeling to encounter  
ease, the absence of transcendence.  

When you sweep the earth clean,  
I hope you feel my form  
through the broom's handle.  

---

6.

Is the world of objects also  
your body, through which you apprehend  
me?  

I walk in the palm of your hand, your mind.  

My senses the blind cane  
you prod me with:  

the same, small alphabet of rays  
and edges in rhythm.  

---

7.

I want to widen the language of approaching you,  
the apertures through  
which you beckon.  

Languages die daily, whole  
lattices of worlds.  

We yearn to summarize, to constrain.  

Unto death it seems I must wrestle  
against certainty,  
which is a shape of death.  

Still as sleep.  Clean as crossroads.  

---

8.

Perhaps machines will pare   
our language down to one  
of number--

even so, there is  
a grammar of relationship,  
formulas and algorithms.  

Perhaps they will find your faces:  
the shapes you love, of love  
and local symmetry.  

Perhaps they can make us  
a philosophy specific to each object.  

---

9.

It's hard to speak without  
some whisper of love, without inhabiting  
the listener.  

I speak, rehearsing your hearing.  

To hear myself I must know myself,  
and know you, the world woven in me,  

I must already have known  
you speaking in me.  

A bird knows the response before she sings,  
and sings because the song  

knits us from mouth, to ear, to mouth.  

---

10.

The old stories imagine you  
with many eyes & mouths & ears & yet  

what use is it to say you are beyond  
material, when even that  

vaults our understanding?  

A parsing of flames we can't articulate  
with tongues or thumbs.  

---

11.

If not silence,  
a listening speech  
a sight seen through  
a wounded touch  

Me filled with you:  

The dance of the self in  
the world in the self.  

---

12.

Light, you spill  
yourself from some abundant core  
I cannot fathom, like the soil.  

The braids are overlaid:  Death  
rounds the corner into life, the ear  
is a mouth.  

---

13.

Each second I scarcely sense  
you: everything eddying, rancid hint of spring.  

I fashion diagrams, talismans  
to quell fear at the expense  

of wonder, moment.  

---

14.

I've wanted to know you like an answer.  

The flower's parts named, the cell  
whose membrane can be drawn.  

A curtain.  You.  And me.  

Though the cells converse among us without end,  
though I cannot find the verge  
of my touch and your body.  

---

15.

I've wanted to use you like a term,  
which comes from *terminus*, or end.  

I've wanted you to end, although  
the word you give is born continually,  

a spiral ratio, a phoenix, *ouroboros*.  

---

16.

I've wanted to be unknown,  
smudged from the articulated earth,  
unreconciled.  

Also, I've wanted to make sense,  
simple as an element.  

To be known in an instant, and also patiently,  
across my inconsistencies.  

As I have tried to taste you, plain  
as bread and wine from  
raucous kitchens.  

---

17.

Silly and lonely, to propel myself  
daily against your chest.  

You are edgeless, when  
I need an end to grasp.  

The ferns darken and clench.  

You chase me.  I retreat  
into the spaces where you wait.  

I pray you talk  
to yourself with me.  

---

18.

I perceive little, remember less.  
By the time I confess my mistakes  

have that digitized look,  
blurry as plans.  

But I really believe in you, reality.  
Each swerve, each syllable  

is tattooed on your skin, indelible:  
each mixed motive, each small  

negligence hidden without  
courage or attention.  

---

19.

"Planning for my future" mostly means  
a self slenderly known, projected on  
a world barely seen.  

I can't believe in a heaven reached by subtraction.  

Fingers round my ribs, I'm still learning  
to hold, with the unconsuming  
fire of love, my sins.
