<h3>Assistance with curiosity</h3>
<p>Recently, re-reading the first volume of Mircea Eliade’s <em>A History of Religious Ideas</em> (the one which covers the period from the Stone Age to the Eleusinian Mysteries), I found myself missing the author, his encyclopedic knowledge and deftness in analogy and synthesis. Despite the breadth of his existing work, I wanted to have him at my shoulder to make me aware of new stories and to find connections within the vast web of human myths and stories.</p>
<p>Eventually, I settled (as we seem to do more and more) for that inert facsimile of the never-resting mind: the encyclopedia, perhaps with hyperlinks to stand in for analogies. During this search I happened upon Stith Thompson’s massive labour of love, the <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Motif-Index_of_Folk-Literature/Volume_1">Motif-Index of Folk-Literature</a> which contains 46230 distinct motifs: the building blocks of “Folktales, Ballads, Myths, Fables, Mediaeval Romances, Exempla, Fabliaux, Jest-Books and Local Legends.” While the index has its limitations for research purposes,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> it serves for my initial goal: the ability to give a broad, impressionistic view of a range of related themes throughout myths.</p>
<p>It turns out that one can do <a href="https://github.com/j-hagedorn/mythos">some web-scraping and tidying up</a> to arrive at a working dataset for these motifs. As for methods, I’m starting out pretty basic. After a few forays applying topic modeling with results which strayed too far from the types of nuanced categories I had hoped for, I settled on simply tagging keywords using regular expressions: a bit more work, but more useful output. Even this is a messy approach,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> as the grouping of some motifs shows. Nevertheless I’ve resisted re-classifying the initial sketch, sticking (for now) with vivid impressions rather than an unassailable classification system.</p>
<p>So… what to explore?</p>
</div>
<div id="why-blood" class="section level3">
<h3>Why blood?</h3>
<p>The first thing I wanted to explore was blood. Blood is at the heart of our hopes and fears, a single substance with veins rooted in life and death. Red hands colored in ochre to resemble blood have been found at Paleolithic sites throughout the world. We have analyzed blood’s chemical composition and use it to quantify our wellness with HbA1c levels and lab workups. Alongside our increasing application of scientific knowledge to develop treatments, blood continues to be used ritually as well. Around the world, millions of Christian believers gather each week to drink the blood of God as part of the millennia-old rite of the Eucharist. Some may take it as a ‘mere symbol’ and some as a mysterious reality, yet the action is rooted deep within our collective history.</p>
<p>Blood is also a figure for our greatest fears: an emblem of life so strong that the loss of it is the harbinger of danger and death. The horror-movie section of Netflix provides ample modern-day examples of this particular connotation. Despite its ubiquity, blood has not become a safe or cliche metaphor; precisely because it is <em>not</em> a metaphor. It is in us.</p>
<p>What is ‘in our blood’ is not merely hemoglobin or lipoproteins, but an entire history of resonances, of stories and ideas about ourselves which color the substance coursing through our veins.</p>
<p>Searching the Thompson Motif Index for ‘blood’ or ‘bleed’, we find 380 entries. By reading through these and flagging keywords which correspond to identified themes, I ended up with a reduced set of 257 entries categorized by theme.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Culling these 19 themes into 7 broader groups yielded the categories used in the discussion below.</p>
<p><img src="/projects/2020-07-13-blood-motif_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="2400" /></p>
<p>By reviewing and classifying the motifs as themes, then clustering together the themes into more abstract groups, several broad characteristics of blood impressed themselves on me. While there are certainly other constellations which could be found, these are a start, however provisional. Based on the motifs in this index, blood is depicted:</p>
<ul>
<li>as a <em>foundational</em> element of the cosmos,</li>
<li>as a <em>life-giving</em> material, vivifying individual beings</li>
<li>as an impetus for <em>reordering</em>, reorienting broken or hurt beings back to the cosmic foundation</li>
<li>as an agent of <em>revelation</em>, showing the true nature of objects, people, or situations</li>
<li>as an agent of <em>transformation</em> or metamorphosis, altering the physical form</li>
<li>as a <em>drink</em> taken to obtain one of the characteristics noted above</li>
<li>as a <em>pollutant</em> (in contradiction to the theme of reordering noted above)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these have distinct, smaller clusters of themes congealed within them, so it is worth dwelling on each in greater detail, as well as providing illustrations of the variety of motifs within each group. The overall structure of these groups, subgroups, and motifs is shown below as a circular network:</p>
<p><img src="/projects/2020-07-13-blood-motif_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Each set of branches from the trunk of this network is briefly discussed in a section below, to give a sense of the diversity of myths and stories represented.</p>
</div>
<div id="cosmic-foundation" class="section level3">
<h3>Cosmic Foundation</h3>
<p>The first and largest set of themes which clustered together were those about the essence of blood. Vital and numinous, blood seethes with the creative power of life itself. It is related to and in some instances constitutes the substance of the soul, which has previously been defined quite differently than our current usage. For the Greeks, the <em>soul</em> was not merely a wisp but the patterning power which governed the unfolding and development of the body. Blood is shown in this way in motifs which describe its nature as soul/spirit or which link it to the basic elemental forces of the world or to the initial creation of the cosmos (i.e. cosmogonic myths).</p>

<p>The use of the word ‘cosmos’, as distinguished from ‘universe’, is intentional here. The accounts of the world which these myths conjure depict the world as personal and harmonious, albeit strange and terrifying as well.</p>
<p>Several additional motifs in this group serve as illustrations of blood’s foundational nature, for instance its use in endorsing contracts and covenants. Since it is a deeper power than the individual interests of those making the deal, it can be relied upon to enforce agreements, allowing them to rest on a force which under-girds particular biases.</p>
<p>Also included here are generic references to the power of blood, linked to its vitality but often also characterized as magical, due to the frequent attempts to harness that numinous vitality for human purposes.</p>
<p>Related to this power, and tied to the notion of ‘soul’ as a patterning power, is the view of blood as a substance which holds knowledge, especially language. In a number of myths, drinking the blood of animals gives understanding of the language of animals. It can also return speech to those who had been unable to speak. In these cases, blood gives speech not merely by healing the speech organs but by giving knowledge of language itself: the patterning power by which creation was spoken or sung into being (e.g. in the <em>Genesis</em> account or the <em>Rg Veda</em>). Language here is an indication of cognition, of understanding. Thus, the vitality of blood may be understood not as a blind force but as a conscious, one might even say personal, energy. This association almost seems a foreshadowing of the discovery of DNA, the inherence of patterning soul and word within individual creatures, folded up in miniature as a word, a sequence of symbols.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>It is this set of intuitions about the cosmic essence of blood which serve as the basis for nearly all other motifs. Because of its vital essence, blood is seen as having a specific and active creative role; not only in a general sense…</p>

<div id="life-giving" class="section level3">
<h3>Life-Giving</h3>
<p>Blood is a seed, causing trees to sprout from the ground where it is spilled<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, or a mandrake to rise up at the foot of the gallows<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Falling from us as we die, it is a signal that the pulse of life transcends our particular existences. People are conceived or born from blood<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, and this potency of blood leads by association to its use as an aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>It has a role not only in starting life, but also in re-starting it: bringing to life what has died, such as in the French fable of the pelican reviving its young<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> which draws on earlier Christian symbolism.</p>

<p>As has likely become obvious already, the membranes between these categories are porous and allow for commerce. The power of blood to bring back to life is echoed in its use for healing and renewal, which are collected in the theme of…</p>
</div>
<div id="reordering" class="section level3">
<h3>Reordering</h3>
<p>The vitality of blood seems to wash away time, erasing the decay of wounds or sickness. One can bathe in blood and be cured of disease,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> use blood to restore sight,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> or even (somewhat paradoxically) have a wound healed by its own blood.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Bathing in blood also has a cleansing function, as in the range of motifs grouped in the category titled <code>cleanse</code>.</p>
<p>The nature of the connection between cleanness and health in these themes is unclear, and it would be a mistake to anachronistically apply our current notions, informed by germ theory. Earlier conceptions of what was “clean” and ritual purity did not necessarily have to do with an absence of germs but with the proximity to situations or materials associated with impurity.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Motifs are also included in this group which refer to the use of blood as a ‘sacrifice’, a literal ‘making sacred’ which restores the cosmos.</p>

<div id="revelation" class="section level3">
<h3>Revelation</h3>
<p>Perhaps because it is a deep substance of the world, blood is able to reveal what is behind initial appearances. It is a kind of communication with transcendent reality, where specific people are given evidence beyond what their limited vantage allows for. Rather than inducing ‘otherworldly’ intuition, it has the effect of producing disenchantment and sobriety.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>When it reveals disobedience or wrongdoing, blood serves as a sign of judgment. Keys and eggs become bloody as a sign of disobedience,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and murderers are found out by blood springing miraculously from themselves or their victims, or bubbling when they wander near.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>When blood comes from certain inanimate objects it reveals the life or more substantial reality of those objects, thereby associating them with reality or truth. In Irish myths, a shrine bleeds to identify its living connection with the reality,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and a desecrated altar also bleeds to communicate the continued power of reality beyond that impure act.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<div id="transformation" class="section level3">
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>Similar to the motifs related to cleansing and healing, where blood brings about a change in the physical state of the person to whom it is applied, there are also stories in which blood transforms a person, animal, or object into something else, or in which blood itself is turned into one of these. So, while blood itself is acknowledged as elemental and as connected with the unfolding of life, it is not necessarily beholden to any specific instance of that life.</p>
<p>It can change the structure of one object or being into another, because it is deeper than any of those provisional forms. The use of blood in covenants, referenced above, also relies on this understanding of the substance.</p>

<h3>Pollution</h3>
<p>Blood gives life but we see it perhaps most often when life seeps from us, so it is associated both with vitality and with the loss of that vitality in death. Often the things associated with death become taboo: these are objects or substances which confer ritual impurity in a religious ceremony or otherwise render someone unclean if they have come into contact. Even the ground can become unclean when it comes into contact with menstrual blood.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A related example would be the rules set out in <em>Leviticus</em>, which keep participants from having contact with substances associated with death or procreation.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> This taboo on blood indicates how thin is the membrane between life and death, how mingled.</p>
<p>Other motifs grouped here refer to the blood of various animals thought to be venomous: snakes, lions, toads, bears, and of course dragons.</p>

<h3>Drink</h3>
<p>When not explicitly tied to the reasons why people were drinking blood (e.g. to transform themselves, or make a pact, etc.), I classified motifs which treated the drinking of blood in a separate category.</p>
<p>While the reason for drinking blood may not be clear in these motifs, the act itself is of interest. Other means of applying blood, such as baths, are present and mentioned above. The ingestion of another creatures blood, the taking of external life into one’s own body through the mouth, the same route by which the body accepts all other nourishment, is so central to myth and to Christian practice that it is worth dwelling upon.</p>
<p>In reviewing the motifs associated with this use of blood, however, we find mostly negative uses: witches sucking blood, ogres drinking the blood of their victims, and similar tales.</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-7" style="width:1000px;height:300px;" class="collapsibleTree html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-7">{"x":{"data":{"name":"drink","SizeOfNode":9.93,"children":[{"name":"drink","SizeOfNode":9.93,"children":[{"name":"Wife Drinks Blood Of Slain Husband","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Tiger Son Of Human Mother Scratches Her And Licks Her Blood","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Human Blood (Flesh) Accidentally Tasted: Brings Desire For Human Flesh","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Witch Sucks Blood","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Toads Suck Blood","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Ogre Sucks Victim's Finger And Drinks All His Blood","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Two Sheep Kill A Fox Who Has Licked Up The Blood They Have Spilled In A Fight","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Tiger Father Of Human Child Licks Its Blood","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Vampire Sucks Blood","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Water-Spirits Are Cannibals: Devour Mortal Victim, Suck Blood","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Witch Sucks Blood From Woman's Or Child's Breasts","SizeOfNode":2.87},{"name":"Witches Suck Blood From The Navel Of A Child Without Anyone Knowing It","SizeOfNode":2.87}]}]},"options":{"hierarchy":["theme","motif_name"],"input":null,"attribute":"notes","linkLength":null,"fontSize":10,"tooltip":false,"collapsed":true,"zoomable":true,"margin":{"top":20,"bottom":20,"left":49.93,"right":410},"fill":"lightsteelblue"}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Admittedly, I had thought to find ritual uses of drinking blood in this group, yet the motifs shown here illustrate why early Christian practice was so often seen as appalling to those who heard about it. This association of blood, one liquid life-force, with water or other drink which are the practical sustenance of life for all humans or other creatures, draw an analogy between blood and nourishment. Since these do not usually involve the drinking of one’s own blood, it is nourishment through taking the blood of another into oneself. In the Eucharist, where the blood of sacrificed creatures is replaced by the blood of God, source of Life itself.</p>
